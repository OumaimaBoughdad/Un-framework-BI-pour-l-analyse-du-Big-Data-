  "title": "Deep Learning-Based Image Recognition for Food Science and Technology: End-to-End Workflows and Domain-Specific Solutions.",
  "abstract": "Deep learning-based image recognition is increasingly reshaping food science, enabling intelligent systems for online grading, rapid quality evaluation, and food safety monitoring. Nevertheless, the adoption of such approaches in food-related domains is often hindered by fragmented practices, limited domain-specific guidance, and methodological inconsistencies. This review synthesizes a modular end-to-end workflow, spanning task formulation, model development, and application, specifically designed for food science. Three representative case studies are examined to illustrate common applications and practices, while highlighting recurring challenges such as limited data availability, inconsistent annotations, and obstacles to submodel integration that constrain reproducibility and scalability. A set of domain-specific strategies is proposed to address these challenges, covering task decomposition, dataset refinement, annotation and label management, image preprocessing, data augmentation, architecture selection, and submodel integration. Looking ahead, we suggest that future efforts prioritize the development of standardized toolkits-task guidance systems, unified modeling toolchains, and model integration platforms-to enable reliable, generalizable, and impactful computer vision solutions for real-world challenges in food science and technology.",

  "abstract": "To identify research trends in glioma radiomics using topic modeling, to analyze development of this field and to determine areas with potential clinical and scientific significance. A comprehensive bibliometric and thematic analysis of literature data on glioma radiomics published between 2014 and 2024 was conducted. We screened the PubMed database using appropriate keywords. After preliminary screening of publications, we used topic modeling and bibliometric analysis to identify key research areas and development trends. The number of publications devoted to glioma radiomics increased between 2014 and 2024. The key research areas included segmentation and extraction of features of glioma radiographic images, validation and reproducibility of machine learning models, molecular classification of gliomas, and survival prediction. These studies highlight the importance of model reproducibility and application of radiomics together with genomic data analysis and artificial intelligence methods. Glioma radiomics demonstrates significant potential for clinical practice, particularly when integrated with molecular and genomic data. Despite rapid development of this field, there are challenges with model reproducibility and protocol standardization limiting their widespread adoption. Available studies demonstrate the need to use multiple-center data and improve interpretability of radiomics features. Future studies should focus on significant clinically applicable models and better integration of radiomics with artificial intelligence for personalized medicine. Glioma radiomics is advancing towards creation of more significant and clinically applicable models. Validation of models on diverse datasets and integration of radiomics with molecular and genomic methods are key areas of future research. Topic modeling enabled identification of key research topics reflecting current state and promising areas of radiomics application in glial tumor research.",

Recent deep learning advances offer promising potential for CI sound coding by integrating visual cues. In this study, an audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) module is integrated with the ElectrodeNet-CS (ECS) model to form the end-to-end CI system, AVSE-ECS. Simulations show that the AVSE-ECS system with joint training achieves high objective speech intelligibility and improves the signal-to-error ratio by 7.4666 dB compared to the advanced combination encoder strategy. These findings underscore the potential of AVSE-based CI sound coding.",

  "abstract": "Data retrieval underpins the success of clinical audits, quality improvement initiatives, and research. Over recent decades, healthcare systems have transitioned from manual chart review to electronic patient record (EPR) systems, informatics-driven queries, and now artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted methods. Each stage has brought improvements in scale and efficiency but has also introduced new challenges in accuracy, coding reliability, and access to clinically meaningful detail. This review traces the evolution of data sourcing methods, from manual extraction to digital workflows, examines the balance between structured and unstructured data, and highlights the emerging role of prompt engineering and natural language processing (NLP). By combining insights from literature and clinical practice, it outlines the limitations of current systems and the opportunities that future innovations may provide.",

  "title": "A machine learning and explainable AI framework for adsorption energy prediction via effective representation of the adsorbate chemical environment.",
  "abstract": "Adsorption energies, which capture the interactions between adsorbates and solid surfaces, are central to heterogeneous catalysis. Machine learning (ML) offers a powerful approach for rapidly and accurately predicting adsorption energies from computational data, thereby accelerating catalyst screening. The effectiveness of ML models depends on accurately representing the chemical environments of atoms, incorporating both geometric and electronic properties that influence adsorbate-surface interactions. In this study, we present an ML framework that leverages advanced electronic structure descriptors via Gaussian Multipole (GMP) featurization. GMP approximates electron density using Gaussian basis functions, providing a novel representation of elemental identity. Combined with robust geometric features, our model predicts CO and H binding energies (ΔECO∗ and ΔEH∗) on multimetallic alloys, achieving mean absolute errors of 0.07 eV for ΔECO∗ and 0.06 eV for ΔEH∗. To interpret the model's predictions, we applied Shapley additive explanations, a post hoc explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) method. The analysis revealed that GMP features associated with adsorbates and their first-nearest neighbors (FNNs) played the most significant role in determining binding energies, while features from second-nearest neighbors had minimal influence. In addition, broader elemental properties such as boiling point, group number, and atomic number were found to be more predictive of adsorption behavior than conventional features, such as electronegativity. Clustering and t-SNE analyses showed that similar FNN environments yield consistent binding energies, supporting the model's ability to generalize. Overall, this work demonstrates that integrating electronic structure features with explainable AI improves both predictive accuracy and interpretability, offering a powerful strategy for accelerated catalyst screening and rational catalyst design.",

  "abstract": "Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major cause of clinical trial failure and postmarket withdrawal, posing significant risks to public health and impeding drug development. While computational methods offer an alternative to costly preclinical testing, existing models often fail with novel compounds by requiring pre-existing information such as drug-ADR associations or by inadequately integrating diverse data sources. Here, we introduce DeepADR, a multimodal deep learning framework for predicting both the occurrence and frequency of ADRs using early-stage, readily available data. DeepADR integrates chemical structures and biological target profiles with semantic representations of ADR terms derived from a large language model (LLMs). These heterogeneous parameters are fused using a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), which enhances the modeling of complex, nonlinear relationships among modalities to improve predictive performance. Our model outperforms existing methods in predicting both ADR occurrence and frequency, demonstrating robust generalization to new chemical entities. DeepADR showed consistently better performance than other models across both classification and regression tasks. By effectively integrating chemical, biological, and semantic datasets, DeepADR provides a powerful, scalable tool for the early-stage safety assessment and candidate prioritization. This framework not only facilitates the prioritization of safer drug candidates but also offers a methodology for predicting the toxicity of other hazardous materials, holding significant promise for advancing public health.",

  "abstract": "This study explores the potential of nursing records in improving pharmaceutical safety by analyzing adverse effects (AEs) using ChatGPT-4 for data categorization. A total of 927 anonymized records from a Japanese community hospital were analyzed through a three-stage protocol: identifying AEs using ChatGPT-4, constructing a co-occurrence network to analyze relationships among key terms, and identifying central patterns using network metrics. Results revealed a high proportion of entries classified as \"Unknown\" for both AE status (674 cases) and patient conditions (865 cases), highlighting documentation gaps. The most frequently documented medicines were Red Blood Cells (123 instances) and Fresh Frozen Plasma (87 instances), while Thermal Therapy (30 instances) and CT Scans (23 instances) were the most used medical devices. However, AE documentation was limited, with only 6 cases for medicines and 2 for devices. The co-occurrence network emphasized the importance of informed consent (IC) in communicating treatment risks, particularly in chemotherapy and antibiotic use. Despite challenges, this study underscores the critical role of nursing records in AE management and calls for standardized documentation and integration. Future efforts could explore combining large language models with human-in-the-loop feedback to further improve AE extraction accuracy from incomplete nursing notes. into clinical workflows to enhance patient safety.",

  "abstract": "The curation of precision oncology knowledge bases requires intensive screening of scientific literature. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential to assist with knowledge extraction and curation through automated abstract screening, though their utility in this context remains unexplored. We developed a decision tree-based pipeline utilising LLMs to automate literature screening for precision oncology knowledge bases. The system employs structured prompts to evaluate biomarker-therapeutic relationships across 8,012 abstracts from 25 oncology journals published in 2024. Performance was assessed against expert review using standard evaluation metrics; the pipeline achieved an overall accuracy of 92.9% (sensitivity [recall] 87.1%, specificity 93.7%) in shortlisting 1,328 candidate abstracts, of which 888 are considered relevant by experts, delivering a 5.26-fold enrichment in classification precision. Analysis of correctly identified abstracts revealed comprehensive coverage of key molecular targets, drug classes (immunotherapies and targeted therapies), and relevant cancer types. This pipeline automates literature triage for precision oncology knowledge bases for relevance, maintaining high specificity and potentially reducing manual screening burden whilst offering a scalable framework for sustainable knowledge base maintenance.",

In contrast, conventional information extraction methods had poor recall and high false positive rates. Moreover, LLMs inferred contextual details, offering enriched insights but occasionally introducing unsupported information. These findings demonstrate the promise of LLMs in automating genomic variant extraction, while also highlighting the need for rigorous validation and careful integration into clinical and research workflows.",

  "abstract": "Frailty represents a particularly challenging aspect of population aging. While international guidelines advocate routine identification to enable evidence-based interventions, existing instruments often demand additional resources, limiting their practical implementation. Electronic tools facilitate the analysis of larger patient populations in less time, optimizing both resources and secondary data utilization. This project aimed to identify frailty using data from electronic medical records in diabetic patients aged 65 years and older. The Electronic Screening Index of Frailty (e-SIF), developed by Serra-Prat et al., was used in this study. This report outlines lessons learned from our experience and the processes involved in implementing this frailty detection tool.",

  "abstract": "Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is a prevalent and critical complication of haemodialysis associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and reduced quality of life in end-stage renal disease patients. IDH results from multifactorial interactions, including excessive ultrafiltration rates (UFR), rapid osmotic shifts, impaired vascular resistance, and comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It triggers hypovolemic stress, leading to myocardial stunning, cerebral ischemia, and organ dysfunction. Non-modifiable risk factors, including age and preexisting conditions, exacerbate susceptibility, while modifiable elements such as high interdialytic weight gain and improper dialysis prescriptions worsen outcomes. In this review, we aim to conduct an in-depth analysis of IDH, exploring its clinical relevance, underlying mechanisms, risk factors, and management approaches. Additionally, we advocate for a standardised definition and propose a strategic framework to guide future research efforts. Effective management requires individualised approaches, including optimised UFR, cooled dialysate, and nutritional adjustments, alongside emerging technologies like bio-impedance spectroscopy and artificial intelligence for real-time risk prediction. A multidisciplinary team approach, incorporating nephrologists, nurses, and dietitians, is essential for holistic patient care. Future research and technological advancements hold promise for mitigating IDH's clinical and systemic impact, ultimately improving patient outcomes and survival.",

  "abstract": "RNA modification, which is evolutionarily conserved, is crucial for modulating various biological functions and disease pathogenesis. High resolution transcriptome-wide mapping of RNA modifications has facilitated both data resources and computational prediction of RNA modification. While these prediction algorithms are promising, they are limited in interpretability or generalizability, or the capacity for discovering novel post-transcriptional regulations. Here, we present NetRNApan, a deep learning framework for RNA modification site prediction, motif discovery and trans-regulatory factor identification. Using m5U profiles generated by FICC-seq and miCLIP-seq technologies and single-base resolution m6A sites from multiple experiments as cases, we demonstrated the accuracy of NetRNApan with more efficient and interpretive feature representations. For m5U modification, we uncovered five representative clusters with consensus motifs that may be essential by decoding the informative characteristics detected by NetRNApan. Furthermore, NetRNApan revealed interesting trans-regulatory factors and provided a protein-binding perspective for investigating the function of RNA modifications. Specifically, we discovered 21 potential functional RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) whose binding sites were significantly linked to the extracted top-scoring motifs for m5U modification. Two examples are ANKHD1 and RBM4 with potential regulatory function of m5U modifications. Meanwhile, the analysis of convolution layer parameters within the model offers valuable insights into the regulation of m6A in humans. Collectively, NetRNApan demonstrated high accuracy, interpretability and generalizability for study of RNA modification and mRNA regulation.

However, their scalability has been fundamentally limited by the high power requirements of conventional nonlinear optical elements. Here, we present a low-power nonlinear activation scheme based on a three-level quantum system driven by dual laser fields. This platform introduces a two-channel nonlinear activation matrix with self- and cross-nonlinearities, enabling true multi-input, multi-output optical processing. The system supports tunable activation behaviors, including sigmoid and ReLU functions, at ultralow power levels (17 W per neuron). We validate our approach through theoretical modeling and experimental demonstration in rubidium vapor cells, showing the feasibility of scaling to deep AONNs with millions of neurons operating under 20 W of total optical power. Crucially, we demonstrate the all-optical generation of gradient-like signals with backpropagation, paving the way for all-optical training. These results mark a significant advance toward scalable, high-speed, and energy-efficient optical AI hardware.",

  "abstract": "Photonics emerges as a paradigmatic enabler for artificial intelligence (AI) and neuromorphic computing architectures, furnishing an avenue for ultra-low-latency, high-bandwidth, and energy-efficient information processing through the manipulation of various photonic degrees of freedom with an optical signal processing procedure. However, conventional optical neural network (ONN) architectures face significant challenges in calculating precision induced by insufficient precision of optoelectronic devices such as digital-to-analog converters (DACs) and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs). Here, we propose an all-digital optical neural network (ADONN) architecture that employs digital binary signals at the optical input of the computation core, with entirely logical signal transmission and processing in the optical domain. Despite its simple architecture, the calculation precision of ONN is greatly improved even at a high computational speed, while simultaneously alleviating the rigorous requirement of optoelectronic devices. To validate our scheme, we build an ADONN architecture through numerical simulation and systematically investigate its comprehensive performance compared with traditional analog ONN architecture. The ADONN scheme achieves a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 3 × 10 at the optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) of 20 dB through a basic optical multiplication test experiment, which corresponds to an 11-bit calculating precision, and is tremendously lower than that of traditional analog implementation. Meanwhile, the edge detection task for high-fidelity image processing is introduced to demonstrate the high precision of ADONN; image convolution with 8-bit resolution is performed using various convolution kernels, and simulation results exhibit that all pixel error rates (PERs) are below 1 with an all-digital computing core. Furthermore, an all-digital optical convolutional neural network (ADOCNN) is also developed and evaluated in the MNIST task with superior accuracy results. Results confirm that the proposed all-digital optical computing paradigm could provide ultra-high calculating precision with relatively low hardware complexity, which could be potentially applied in various modern ONN applications.",

  "title": "Mode vector modulation: receiver architectures and DSP algorithms for polarization tracking.",
  "abstract": "The emergence of modern hyperscale datacenters and artificial general intelligence (AGI) supercomputers creates an unprecedented demand for high-speed, scalable optical interconnects. Contemporary datacenter optical networks rely on pluggable transponders using -ary pulse amplitude modulation (-PAM) and direct detection (DD). To scale capacity, the prevailing strategy is to use parallel fiber strands that carry independent -PAM/DD tributaries, a form of space-division multiplexing (SDM). Meanwhile, multicore fibers (MCFs) with nominally uncoupled, homogeneous, single-mode cores are intended to replace fiber strands in the future to reduce fiber count and simplify data center connectivity. Rather than treating each MCF core as an independent lightpath, we can exploit all MCF spatial and polarization degrees of freedom jointly to transmit multidimensional symbols via space modulation-a format we term mode vector modulation (MVM). This paper presents several novel MVM DD receiver architectures, each offering a different balance between hardware complexity and performance. In parallel, we introduce and evaluate a suite of digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms for polarization tracking, including both blind and pilot-assisted methods. Together, these innovations enhance the practicality of MVM as a high-sensitivity, bandwidth-efficient alternative to -PAM for future direct-detection-based optical interconnects.",

  "abstract": "The exponential growth of data center traffic, driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and high-performance computing, demands optical interconnect solutions that overcome the limitations of current packaging integration methods. The conventional bonding process often suffers from substantial parasitic effects, which degrade signal integrity and limit both bandwidth scalability and energy efficiency. Here, we present a monolithically integrated electronic-photonic transceiver fabricated for a 45 nm CMOS-SOI platform, featuring a co-designed Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM), driver amplifier, Ge-Si photodetector (PD), and transimpedance amplifier (TIA) within a single chip. By eliminating bonding interfaces in optoelectronic integration, the transmitter achieves a 64 Gbaud four-level pulse amplitude modulation (PAM-4) data transmission below the 5.8% overhead hard-decision (HD) forward error correction (FEC) bit error rate (BER) threshold of 3.8 × 10, while the receiver achieves a 64 Gbaud PAM-4 data transmission below the 6.7% overhead KP4-FEC threshold of 2.4 × 10. The integrated tranceivers consume the total power consumption of 3.07 pJ/bit at 128 Gb/s.

  "title": "A future of data-rich pharmacoepidemiology studies: transitioning to large-scale linked electronic health record + claims data.",
  "abstract": "Electronic health record (EHR) data are seen as an important source for pharmacoepidemiology studies. In the US health-care system, EHR systems often identify only fragments of patients' health information across the care continuum, including primary care, specialist care, hospitalizations, and pharmacy dispensing. This leads to unobservable information in longitudinal evaluations of medication effects, causing unmeasured confounding, misclassification, and truncated follow-up times. A remedy is to link EHR data with longitudinal health insurance claims data, which record all encounters during a defined enrollment period across all care settings. Here we evaluate EHR and claims data sources in 3 aspects relevant to etiological studies of medical products: data continuity, data granularity, and data chronology. Reflecting on the strengths and limitations of EHR and insurance claims data, it becomes obvious that they complement each other. The combination of both will improve the validity of etiological studies and expand the range of questions that can be answered. As the research community transitions towards a future state with access to large-scale combined EHR + claims data, we outline analytical templates to improve the validity and broaden the scope of pharmacoepidemiology studies in the current environment where EHR data are available only for a subset of patients with claims data.

  "abstract": "Intensive care unit (ICU) acquired sarcopenia and myosteatosis are increasingly recognized complications of critical illness, characterized by a rapid loss of skeletal muscle mass, quality, and function. These conditions result from a complex interplay of systemic inflammation, immobilization, catabolic stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and immune dysregulation, often culminating in impaired recovery, prolonged hospitalization, and increased long-term mortality. First identified in survivors of sepsis and prolonged mechanical ventilation, these muscle abnormalities were initially described using computed tomography-based assessments of muscle area and density. Subsequent advances in imaging, biomarker discovery, and functional testing have enabled earlier detection and risk stratification across diverse ICU populations. While nutritional optimization and early mobilization form the cornerstone of current prevention and treatment strategies, the emergence of novel approaches, including automated artificial intelligence-based screening, neuromuscular electrical stimulation, and targeted pharmacologic therapies, has broadened the clinical scope of interventions. Despite their significant prognostic implications, ICU-acquired sarcopenia and myosteatosis remain under-recognized in routine critical care practice. This mini-review aims to synthesize current knowledge regarding their pathophysiology, available diagnostic modalities, prognostic relevance, and the evolving landscape of therapeutic strategies for long-term functional recovery in critically ill patients.",

  "title": "Systemic Challenges to Lung Cancer Screening in the Safety-Net Setting: Care and Informatics Fragmentation.",
  "abstract": "Despite being the leading cause of cancer death, <20% of eligible, at-risk Americans undergo lung cancer screening. Lung cancer risk is concentrated in lower-income populations, but Medicaid-insured populations consistently have the lowest screening rates across cancers. To improve lung cancer screening rates and outcomes, we must understand the systemic challenges of orchestrating a complete episode of multidisciplinary care, from radiographic screening to treatment, in the resource-limited, safety-net environment. We performed a qualitative case study of purposively sampled imaging-based cancer screening programs in safety-net organizations serving high-need populations in Los Angeles County, identified by geospatial techniques. Using a semistructured guide, organizational screening experts were prompted in hour-long telephone interviews between November 28, 2023, and February 12, 2024, to describe their organization's imaging-based \"screening pipeline,\" including how they interfaced with external organizations to complete multidisciplinary screening to treatment. Audio was securely recorded, transcribed, and analyzed, using inductive thematic analysis. Four diverse organizations provided insight. Respondents highlighted two main resource-intensive systemic challenges: (1) fragmentation of care across multiple organizations and (2) siloed health information, particularly imaging. These interrelated challenges precluded simplification or automation of screening processes, prompting organizations to resort to manual, labor-intensive workarounds to partially overcome these systemic issues. Care and informatics fragmentation particularly deplete safety-net resources and cause organized cancer screening programs to be unduly labor-intensive in this setting. These challenges were prevalent even in well-established screening programs, like breast, reinforcing that comprehensive, equity-based screening solutions transcend individual organizations.",

  "title": "Opportunities for Predicting Lung Cancer Screening Nonadherence: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.",
  "abstract": "The low adherence rate to annual lung cancer screening (LCS) reduces potential mortality benefits. Interventions to improve adherence often do not consider individualized risk for nonadherence, which is vital in informing the design of tailored interventions. The authors systematically reviewed the literature and conducted a meta-analysis on predicting LCS nonadherence risk using machine learning. The authors searched citation databases such as PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for original studies that mentioned LCS nonadherence risk assessment between April 28, 2014, and May 8, 2025. Study characteristics, nonadherence information, and prediction model performance were extracted. The review protocol was registered with the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO CRD420251049715). Nine studies published between 2020 and 2025 were included in this systematic review, with sample sizes varying between 168 and 28,294, from various institutional settings. Four of the nine included studies reported prediction model performance, with a pooled cross-validated or internal test area under the receiver operating characteristics curve of 0.80 (95% confidence interval, 0.64-0.90) across three distinct study populations and a relatively small sample size between 168 and 2,430, with large heterogeneity detected across studies (P < .05, Cochran's Q test; I = 98.7%). The authors also explored the feasibility of leveraging four national databases to support future model development and validation efforts aimed at improving LCS adherence. Machine learning models that can predict the individual risk for LCS nonadherence are underdeveloped. Radiologists and other stakeholders should invest in the curation of large, multicenter, national databases to facilitate the development and validation of models that identify patients who are in the greatest need of tailored interventions to improve adherence and enhance patient outcomes.",

  "title": "FEMBA: Efficient and Scalable EEG Analysis with a Bidirectional Mamba Foundation Model.",
  "abstract": "Accurate and efficient electroencephalography (EEG) analysis is essential for detecting seizures and artifacts in long-term monitoring, with applications spanning hospital diagnostics to wearable health devices. Robust EEG analytics have the potential to greatly improve patient care. However, traditional deep learning models, especially Transformer-based architectures, are hindered by their quadratic time and memory complexity, making them less suitable for resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we present FEMBA (Foundational EEG Mamba + Bidirectional Architecture), a novel self-supervised framework that establishes new efficiency benchmarks for EEG analysis through bidirectional state-space modeling. Unlike Transformer-based models, which incur quadratic time and memory complexity, FEMBA scales linearly with sequence length, enabling more scalable and efficient processing of extended EEG recordings. Trained on over 21,000 hours of unlabeled EEG and fine-tuned on three downstream tasks, FEMBA achieves competitive performance in comparison with transformer models, with significantly lower computational cost. Specifically, it reaches 81.82% balanced accuracy (0.8921 AUROC) on TUAB and 0.949 AUROC on TUAR, while a tiny 7.8M-parameter variant demonstrates viability for resource-constrained devices. These results pave the way for scalable, general-purpose EEG analytics in both clinical and highlight FEMBA as a promising candidate for wearable applications.Clinical relevanceBy reducing model size and computational overhead, FEMBA enables continuous on-device EEG monitoring for tasks like seizure detection and artifact reduction, promising improved patient care through timely and cost-effective neuro-monitoring solutions.",

  "title": "PriorPath: Coarse-To-Fine Approach for Controlled De-Novo Pathology Semantic Masks Generation.",
  "abstract": "Incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) into digital pathology offers promising prospects for automating and enhancing tasks such as image analysis and diagnostic processes. However, the diversity of tissue samples and the necessity for meticulous image labeling often result in biased datasets, constraining the applicability of algorithms trained on them. To harness synthetic histopathological images to cope with this challenge, it is essential not only to produce photorealistic images but also to be able to exert control over the cellular characteristics they depict. Previous studies used methods to generate, from random noise, semantic masks that captured the spatial distribution of the tissue. These masks were then used as a prior for conditional generative approaches to produce photorealistic histopathological images. However, as with many other generative models, this solution exhibits mode collapse as the model fails to capture the full diversity of the underlying data distribution. In this work, we present a pipeline, coined PriorPath, that generates detailed, realistic, semantic masks derived from coarse-grained images delineating tissue regions. This approach enables control over the spatial arrangement of the generated masks and, consequently, the resulting synthetic images. We demonstrated the efficacy of our method across three cancer types, skin, prostate, and lung, showcasing PriorPath's capability to cover the semantic mask space and to provide better similarity to real masks compared to previous methods. Our approach allows for specifying desired tissue distributions and obtaining both photorealistic masks and images within a single platform, thus providing a state-of-the-art, controllable solution for generating histopathological images to facilitate AI for computational pathology.Clinical relevance- The generation of synthetic histopathological images with precise semantic control over tissue distributions offers significant potential for advancing computational pathology. By allowing AI developers and pathologists to specify desired tissue features and configurations, our approach facilitates the creation of robust and unbiased AI models, supporting clinical decision support tools, improved diagnostics, and early cancer detection.",

  "abstract": "Intracortical brain-machine interfaces demand low-latency, energy-efficient solutions for neural decoding. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) deployed on neuromorphic hardware have demonstrated remarkable efficiency in neural decoding by leveraging sparse binary activations and efficient spatiotemporal processing. However, reducing the computational cost of SNNs remains a critical challenge for developing ultra-efficient intracortical neural implants. In this work, we introduce a novel adaptive pruning algorithm specifically designed for SNNs with high activation sparsity, targeting intracortical neural decoding. Our method dynamically adjusts pruning decisions and employs a rollback mechanism to selectively eliminate redundant synaptic connections without compromising decoding accuracy. Experimental evaluation on the NeuroBench Non-Human Primate (NHP) Motor Prediction benchmark shows that our pruned network achieves performance comparable to dense networks, with a maximum tenfold improvement in efficiency. Moreover, hardware simulation on the neuromorphic processor reveals that the pruned network operates at sub-μW power levels, underscoring its potential for energy-constrained neural implants. These results underscore the promise of our approach for advancing energy-efficient intracortical brain-machine interfaces with low-overhead on-device intelligence.",

  "abstract": "Deep learning has shown strong potential for detecting depression from speech. However, speaker-specific traits and language differences can cause feature shifts, limiting the model's ability to generalize across individuals and languages. To overcome this challenge, we propose a Multi-Domain Feature Alignment (MDFA) model that minimizes the impact of individual and language differences on depression-related features. Using gradient reversal techniques, our approach reduces the feature encoder's sensitivity to speaker and language-specific traits, allowing the model to focus on depression-related patterns for more effective classification. Experimental results on datasets from different languages, including DAIC-WoZ and Androids, demonstrate that the MDFA model significantly improves generalization across individuals and enhances performance in cross-language tasks.",

  "abstract": "Predicting the effectiveness of deep brain stimulation (DBS) for Parkinson's disease (PD) remains challenging due to the variability of individual responses. Local field potentials (LFPs) derived from intraoperative microelectrode recordings (MERs) within the subthalamic nucleus (STN) during DBS surgery reflect the neural activity associated with motor function in patients with PD. These signals can be utilized to assess the potential improvement index in response to therapeutic interventions. This study investigates the use of machine learning to predict DBS treatment outcomes prior to therapy. We present the evaluation of regression machine learning model to predict the improvement index of each PD patient using MER data. MERs were analyzed to extract significant features using Pearson correlation. A random forest regression model was able to achieve the optimal mean squared error (MSE) of 2.739 and coefficient of determination (R) of 0.700 in the right-side improvement prediction. These findings suggest that MERs analysis combined with machine learning demonstrates potential for initially predicting personalized prediction of DBS outcomes in PD patients.Clinical relevance- These findings may enable clinicians to better predict individual patient responses to DBS therapy, potentially leading to more personalized treatment plans and improved clinical outcomes for people with PD.",

  "abstract": "Brain-computer interface (BCI) systems create a novel communication method between humans and machines by translating human thoughts into actionable commands to control external devices. Motor imagery (MI) electroencephalogram (EEG) signals have significant applicability in various medical and non-medical industries, including stroke rehabilitation, wheelchair control, and drone operation. However, the practical application of EEG remains limited by the decoding performance and generalization ability of MI signalsThis study introduces a multi-branch self-attention network for motor imagery (MI) signal classification. Each branch independently processes EEG signals decomposed into distinct frequency bands through convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and multi-head self-attention (MHA) mechanisms, enabling the extraction of both fundamental and discriminative spatial-temporal features. To further capture dynamic temporal dependencies, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are integrated. We systematically evaluate three signal decomposition ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD), wavelet packet decomposition (WPD), and brain rhythm-based decomposition-to optimize feature representation. Extensive experiments on the BCI Competition IV 2a dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with subject-dependent and subject-independent accuracies of 84.04% and 71.67%, respectively. Comparative analyses against benchmark models (EEGNet, EEGTCNet, ShallowConvNet, etc.) validate the superiority of our approach in classification accuracy and generalization capabilityClinical relevance- This study investigates the methods for decoding motor imagery EEG signals and establishes the positive role of each module in classification. The improvement in accuracy can lead to better outcomes in medical applications such as controlling prosthetics, wheelchairs, and stroke rehabilitation.",

  "title": "Estimating the difficulty of medical classification tasks using 3D image datasets.",
  "abstract": "Medical deep learning development has seen a rise in recent years. However, for certain applications the model performance remains low compared to other medical applications. To give an early indication of the expected performance for a particular task, developers often start time and resource-consuming benchmark studies, involving training many deep learning models. In this work we instead aim to create a metric for estimating how challenging a classification task is, based on image features of the dataset. Two dataset difficulty metrics, Silhouette score (SIL) and Fréchet inception distance (FID), are applied to 3D medical image classification datasets, based on radiomic features. These metrics are compared to the performance of two deep learning models, to estimate each metric's ability to predict dataset difficulty. The SIL metric shows the strongest correlation to deep learning model performance and indicates potential to estimate dataset difficulty. Further analysis of image feature extraction and difficulty estimation metrics can potentially improve the distinction of datasets in the medical field. This can guide not only the allocation of time and resources on different projects but also further data curation and model development together with clinicians. To promote reproducibility, the code used in this study is available on github at https://github.com/TereseT/Dataset_evaluation.Clinical relevance- This approach can be used to estimate the difficulty of a dataset for computer-aided diagnosis and indicate if further data curation is needed.",

  "title": "Respiratory Inhaler Sound Event Classification Using Self-Supervised Learning.",
  "abstract": "Asthma is a chronic respiratory condition that affects millions of people worldwide. While this condition can be managed by administering controller medications through handheld inhalers, clinical studies have shown low adherence to the correct inhaler usage technique. Consequently, many patients may not receive the full benefit of their medication. Automated classification of inhaler sounds has recently been studied to assess medication adherence. However, the existing classification models were typically trained using data from specific inhaler types, and their ability to generalize to sounds from different inhalers remains unexplored. In this study, we adapted the wav2vec 2.0 self-supervised learning model for inhaler sound classification by pre-training and fine-tuning this model on inhaler sounds. The proposed model shows a balanced accuracy of 98% on a dataset collected using a dry powder inhaler and a smartwatch device. The results also demonstrate that re-finetuning this model on minimal data from a target inhaler is a promising approach to adapting a generic inhaler sound classification model to a different inhaler device and audio capture hardware. This is the first study in the field to demonstrate the potential of smartwatches as assistive technologies for the personalized monitoring of inhaler adherence using machine learning models.Clinical relevance-Accurate classification of inhaler sounds, which can be captured using consumer devices, is an essential step toward developing personalized systems for assessing inhaler compliance, which can improve patient outcomes by ensuring proper medication delivery and effectiveness. Individual monitoring of inhaler adherence could also play a key role in evaluating medication efficacy in future personalized medicine clinical trials.",

  "abstract": "Large-scale screening for cardiac arrhythmia, such as atrial fibrillation, using wearable and hand-held devices gain importance in modern diagnostics. However, due to the electrode characteristics, these devices often incorporate signal conditioning that potentially distorts the typical ECG morphology, significantly aggravating the subsequent diagnosis. To overcome this issue, we propose a deep learning-based inverse filtering approach using a U-Net autoencoder to reconstruct clean single-lead ECG signals. A synthetic dataset was generated using the MIMIC-IV database and an object-oriented model simulating the device's characteristics, producing paired noisy and clean ECGs for training the neural network. Evaluation of synthetic data showed effective reconstruction capabilities, preserving key ECG features with an MSE of 0.052 on the validation set and 0.134 on the test set. Additionally, the performance was evaluated on real-world data recorded from the MyDiagnostick single-lead ECG device and a reference patient monitor, yielding an overall improvement in extracting the most important temporal ECG features such as PQ interval, QRS duration and QTc time.Clinical relevance- The proposed deep learning-based inverse filtering approach enhances the diagnostic utility of single-lead ECG devices by mitigating signal distortions introduced by dry electrodes and filtering artifacts. By improving the extraction of important temporal ECG features, such as PQ interval, QRS duration, and QTc time, this method can help to enhance clinical decision-making, particularly in large-scale screening for atrial fibrillation and other cardiac conditions.",

  "title": "DentalCLIP: Semi-Supervised Contrastive Learning for TMJ Osteoarthritis Diagnosis.",
  "abstract": "Temporomandibular Joint Osteoarthritis (TMJOA) is a prevalent degenerative disorder characterized by pain, functional impairment, and malocclusion, profoundly impacting patients' quality of life. Early and precise diagnosis is critical to mitigate disease progression; however, the detection of subtle morphological changes in the initial stages presents significant diagnostic challenges. Conventional diagnosis necessitates both cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) and panoramic radiography (PR) from the same patient, limiting the availability of comprehensive and well-annotated datasets. To address this limitation, we propose DentalCLIP, a contrastive semi-supervised learning framework designed to enhance TMJOA diagnosis using PR. DentalCLIP fine-tunes the contrastive language-image pretraining (CLIP) model by aligning image and text features through contrastive learning, while incorporating pseudo-labeling to leverage unlabeled data, thereby mitigating the scarcity of labeled medical datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that DentalCLIP not only outperforms the vanilla CLIP model but also surpasses domain-specific pretrained models such as BiomedCLIP and MedCLIP on our dataset, attaining an accuracy of 0.929 ± 0.012 and an F1-score of 0.929 ± 0.012. These findings underscore the effectiveness of contrastive semi-supervised learning in medical imaging, enhancing diagnostic performance and accessibility, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios with limited labeled data.",

  "title": "Masked Autoencoder with Swin Transformer Network for Mitigating Electrode Shift in HD-EMG-based Gesture Recognition.",
  "abstract": "Multi-channel surface Electromyography (sEMG), also referred to as high-density sEMG (HD-sEMG), plays a crucial role in improving gesture recognition performance for myoelectric control. Pattern recognition models developed based on HD-sEMG, however, are vulnerable to changing recording conditions (e.g., signal variability due to electrode shift). This has resulted in significant degradation in performance across subjects, and sessions. In this context, the paper proposes the Masked Autoencoder with Swin Transformer (MAST) framework, where training is performed on a masked subset of HD-sEMG channels. A combination of four masking strategies, i.e., random block masking; temporal masking; sensor-wise random masking, and; multi-scale masking, is used to learn latent representations and increase robustness against electrode shift. The masked data is then passed through MAST's three-path encoder-decoder structure, leveraging a multi-path Swin-Unet architecture that simultaneously captures time-domain, frequency-domain, and magnitude-based features of the underlying HD-sEMG signal. These augmented inputs are then used in a self-supervised pre-training fashion to improve the model's generalization capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MAST framework in comparison to its counterparts.",

  "abstract": "To produce training labels for diagnostic classifiers of acute infection for sepsis, an adjudication process involving manual chart review by one or more clinicians is current standard practice. This process is costly and varies from clinician to clinician. Acute infections can be difficult to definitively diagnose with resulting 'silver-standard' adjudications depending on clinician's subjective judgement. We leverage an international, multi-cohort dataset of multi-clinician-adjudicated acute infections to develop and evaluate a machine learning (ML)-based system for automated adjudication. We tested the performance and robustness to missing data of several off-the-shelf ML models in a benchmark study, tested the calibration of their output probabilities, and assessed what minimal set of features would be required to maintain performance in future studies. The resulting system, based on a logistic regression model, is accurate and well-calibrated enabling low-cost, reproducible and highly scalable adjudication of acute infection for downstream diagnostic classifier development.Clinical relevance-This work aims to automate the resource-intensive and variable process of chart review for adjudication of acute infection. Our approach makes adjudication of challenging, 'silver standard' acute infections reproducible and scalable to future studies, enabling more rapid, cost-effective incorporation of these studies in downstream development of diagnostic classifiers for sepsis. In addition, automating the chart review process could allow clinicians to spend more time on patient care.",

  "abstract": "Demand for shoulder arthroplasty is rising at a faster rate than hip and knee arthroplasty, driven by an increasingly aging yet active population. Joint registries are playing an increasingly critical role in tracking the long-term success of shoulder arthroplasty, identifying failure mechanisms, and shaping clinical best practices but current classification procedures are often performed by non-medically trained encoders leading to error. This study examines the use of machine learning in techniques to classify four broad categories of shoulder arthroplasty technique from postoperative x-rays. Data from the Scottish Arthroplasty Project, was used to create a balanced dataset of 1000 samples. A 10-fold cross validation was used for the training of 4 neural network models commonly used for classification of x-ray data. InceptionV3 model achieved the highest overall performance with an accuracy of 93.85% after cross validation, while EfficientNet demonstrated the highest individual classifier accuracy of 99% suggesting the potential to increase accuracy further in future studies.Clinical Relevance- This research highlights the potential of machine learning to enhance the accuracy of joint registry data encoding.

In this study, we propose a novel multi-instance learning model GLAM to mine fine-grained tertiary lymphoid structure (TLS) features and global immune microenvironment features from H&E-stained whole-slide images (WSI) to predict multiple clinical end-events that can reflect individualized short-term and long-term efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy in lung cancer. We first train a network to predict TLS maturity, a prognostic indicator for immunotherapy, using a semi-supervised learning method. Then we combine fine-grained TLS features and global immune features via cross-attention and build a multi-instance learning model with self-attention to predict efficacy end-events. This study includes 194 lung cancer patients with post-operative WSI who received neoadjuvant immunotherapy, and the GLAM model demonstrates strong predictive performance across both short-term and long-term efficacy endpoints. For short-term efficacy endpoints, it achieves AUC=0.951 for predicting major pathological response, and AUC=0.864 for predicting pathological complete response. For long-term efficacy endpoints, it achieves AUC=0.911 for predicting 2.5-year recurrence status, and C-Index=0.805 for predicting individualized recurrence time.Clinical Relevance- This study provides a new method for predicting individualized short-term and long-term efficacy of neoadjuvant immunotherapy, which helps guiding personalized treatment planning for lung cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant immunotherapy.",

  "abstract": "Adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) represents a promising advancement in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD), offering personalized therapy through real-time adaptability. This study investigates the feasibility of utilizing a head-mounted triaxial accelerometer to detect human motions for a low-power, fully body-embedded aDBS system. We recruited 32 healthy participants to perform daily activities including sitting, standing, walking, and falling, while wearing the accelerometer on their heads. To classify these motions, we employed machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). Our results indicated that the Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel SVM achieved the highest classification accuracy, exceeding 80%. However, differentiating between sitting and standing posed a challenge. Notably, the inclusion of a \"pre-subsequent motion\" feature significantly enhanced performance, resulting in an accuracy of over 96%. This study establishes a robust framework for feature analysis and machine learning algorithm selection in the realm of human motion recognition through a head-mounted accelerometer.Clinical Relevance- This study outlines a method for detecting human motions through head acceleration, which can be deployed in an adaptive deep brain stimulation device.",

  "abstract": "This study classifies and estimates the intensity of multiple emotional states using physiological signals. We employed a jigsaw puzzle task to elicit both positive and negative emotions in participants. Mood states were assessed using the profile of mood states 2nd Edition (POMS2), while electroencephalogram (EEG) and heart rate variability (HRV) signals were recorded simultaneously. Support vector machines (SVMs) were used for emotion classification. Feature extraction techniques were applied to enhance classification accuracy, including principal component analysis (PCA) and autoencoders (AE). Recursive feature elimination (RFE) was utilized to identify key physiological indicators. When PCA or AE preprocessing was applied, the classification model achieved a κ coefficient of over 0.9 for all emotions. The key features for emotion classification were identified as mean RR interval (MRRI), low-frequency power (LF), high-frequency power (HF), ratio, and prefrontal alpha asymmetry (Fp1α-Fp2α), whereas HF, standard deviation of RR intervals, LF, and F7α-F8α showed lower importance. The findings suggest that EEG and HRV signals can classify and estimate multiple emotional states simultaneously. These results contribute to developing objective emotion recognition systems for applications in mental health monitoring and affective computing.Clinical Relevance- Accurately assessing emotional states is crucial for mental health care, stress management, and affective computing applications. The proposed emotion classification model utilizing EEG and HRV signals provides an objective and quantitative approach to evaluating mood states. This study demonstrates the feasibility of non-invasive physiological monitoring for mental well-being assessment, offering potential applications in workplace stress management, early detection of mood disorders, and human-computer interaction systems.",

  "title": "IDNoise: Resource-Aware Machine Learning-Based Noise and SNR Detection in Electrocardiogram Signals.",
  "abstract": "Noise is a significant challenge in wearable Electrocardiography (ECG), as it can distort the ECG waveform and lead to inaccurate signal interpretation. Among noise sources, Motion Artifcats (MA)s are particularly difficult to mitigate due to their unpredictable time-frequency characteristics. Unlike electromagnetic interference, MAs often overlap with critical spectral components of the ECG signal, making their reduction in preprocessing especially challenging. In this work, we propose IDNoise, a Machine Learning (ML)-based approach for detection and identification of noise in ECG recordings. Our method leverages a comprehensive feature set, including morphological, statistical, and concatenated features, to train ML models capable of distinguishing various noise types and estimating their Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR). We evaluate the proposed algorithms in terms of execution time, energy consumption, and memory usage, which are critical resource usage metrics when designing solutions for wearable devices. We demonstrate that IDNoise, when using concatenated features, can detect the noise type in binary classification with an accuracy of 80.52% and an F1-score of 80.44%. It can also detect the noise type in 4-class classification with an accuracy of 67.91% and an F1-score of 67.89%, and identify the SNR level in 7-class classification with an accuracy of 44.80% and an F1-score of 44.57%. While the use of concatenated features necessitates, during the feature extraction phase, an increase in computational overhead of a factor up to 7.5 times (execution time, energy consumption, and memory usage). The computational overhead for prediction and loading the models remain comparable to that of individual features.",

  "abstract": "The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare workflows offers transformative potential to streamline processes and enhance patient experience and outcomes. This paper presents a novel AI-powered chatbot that leverages a large language model (LLM) to conduct context-aware and adaptive conversations for patient triage and information gathering. The system integrates physician-guided prompts, triage notes, and patient history, including electronic health record (EHR) data, to dynamically refine clinical insights through iterative questioning. The chatbot ensures compliance with healthcare data standards while generating structured clinical summaries for physicians. Evaluations across ten gastroenterology/hepatology scenarios, reviewed by independent hepatologists, demonstrated high performance (scores 4.0-5.0/5.0) in documentation quality, assessment accuracy, patient education, and management planning. User ratings closely aligned with physician assessments, underscoring clinical relevance and user satisfaction. Through patient-facing Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) integration with EHR data, the system reduces redundant history-taking and bridges critical gaps between triage and care. Such systems can streamline previsit workflows, enhance patient-provider communication, and improve clinical efficiency. This work highlights the viability of LLM-driven patient-facing chatbots to improve clinic efficiency, patient engagement, and diagnostic accuracy in healthcare workflows.",

  "abstract": "Colon cancer is one of the deadliest types of cancer in the United States, with close to 50,000 projected deaths in 2024. The disease requires early diagnosis to optimize chances of survival by enabling timely administration of treatment. To investigate the key non-genetic (NG) factors influencing the onset of colon cancer and evaluate how genetic factors enhance the performance of machine learning (ML) models in predicting incidence, we incorporated polygenic risk scores (PRSs) alongside NG data in ML models to predict 10-year incident risk prediction of colon cancer using data from the UK Biobank. This approach enabled us to assess the added predictive value of PRSs in multi-modal models in estimating the 10-year risk of developing colon cancer over NG data alone. Moreover, our research focused on identifying the most relevant and predictive PRS and validating them using a robust ML framework. To ensure the robustness, we restricted the cohort to White British individuals to minimize ancestry-related heterogeneity. PRSs have proven effective in enhancing disease prediction for conditions such as breast cancer, myocardial infarction, and schizophrenia, reinforcing their relevance in clinical research. Exploring six PRSs, our goal was to minimize false negatives while simultaneously maximizing area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), in order to improve early detection rates by identifying those who are at risk for colon cancer. This research shows that PRSs can be used to enhance overall predictive ability of ML models in colon cancer research over NG factors alone, bolstering the argument for incorporating PRSs into routine clinical practice. PRSs can also help minimize false negatives, a key feature for disease prediction models, as missed potential diagnoses are life-threatening.",

  "abstract": "This paper introduces a novel method for monitoring patients' ability to perform hip flexion motions and adapting the range of motion based on their individual capabilities. The aim is to optimize rehabilitation outcomes by appropriately challenging patients during the early stages of mobilization. Leveraging the concept of Challenge-As-Needed (CAN) control, we implemented this approach on a robotic device for very early mobilization, building upon the Assist-As-Needed (AAN) control framework. Testing was conducted with a single healthy subject, demonstrating potential for future clinical applications. Results indicate the effectiveness of our supplementary method in adjusting the range of motion (ROM) of robotic rehabilitation devices. By employing real-time sensing and making minor adjustments, our approach successfully identified instances where patients were ready to expand their maximal hip ROM, thus accommodating their needs effectively. Within the study, a pre-study was undertaken to identify the most suitable control variable, guiding the design and implementation of our control algorithm. Application of this algorithm to patient data yielded promising outcomes, suggesting its potential to enhance rehabilitation outcomes in future clinical settings.",

  "abstract": "Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a pervasive global health challenge that necessitates early and accurate diagnosis for effective management. Renal ultrasound imaging is integral to CKD evaluation; however, precise segmentation of kidney structures is often compromised in advanced stages due to degraded image quality. In this work, we propose a novel semi-supervised segmentation framework that synergistically integrates Pseudo-Label Guided Contrastive Loss (PLGCL) with the ST++ learning strategy. By leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data, our method enhances segmentation accuracy. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art techniques, achieving significantly higher Dice coefficients across all CKD stages, with marked improvements observed in late-stage disease (G4 and G5). These findings underscore the potential of combining contrastive learning and pseudo-labeling to address the challenges of ultrasound image segmentation in complex clinical scenarios.Clinical Relevance- The proposed framework enhances the delineation of renal structures in ultrasound imaging, particularly in advanced CKD stages, thereby supporting more accurate assessments of disease progression. Improved segmentation fidelity can facilitate optimal treatment planning and clinical decision-making, ultimately contributing to better patient outcomes through more reliable morphological evaluations of the kidneys.",

  "abstract": "Type II diabetes is a serious problem because of its increasing prevalence in both adults and younger populations worldwide. In this paper, we propose HemoGraph, a deep learning-based method that uses social and behavioral determinants of health for diabetes pre-screening. HemoGraph utilizes graph neural networks to explicitly model the relationships between input features. Adopting the Learning Under Privileged Information (LUPI) framework, HemoGraph learns from lab test results during training, which are not accessible at inference time. We train and evaluate HemoGraph on real-world data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2018). Our model reaches a recall of 71.56%, achieving a significant 22% improvement compared to the American Diabetes Association self-test tool, while attaining higher overall performance.",

  "title": "Individualised Treatment Effects Estimation with Composite Treatments and Composite Outcomes.",
  "abstract": "Estimating individualised treatment effect (ITE) - that is the causal effect of a set of variables (also called exposures, treatments, actions, policies, or interventions), referred to as composite treatments, on a set of outcome variables of interest, referred to as composite outcomes, for a unit from observational data - remains a fundamental problem in causal inference with applications across disciplines, such as healthcare, economics, education, social science, marketing, and computer science. Previous work in causal machine learning for ITE estimation is limited to simple settings, like single treatments and single outcomes. This hinders their use in complex real-world scenarios; for example, consider studying the effect of different ICU interventions, such as beta-blockers and statins for a patient admitted for heart surgery, on different outcomes of interest such as atrial fibrillation and in-hospital mortality. The limited research into composite treatments and outcomes is primarily due to data scarcity for all treatments and outcomes. To address the above challenges, we propose a novel and innovative hypernetwork-based approach, called H-Learner, to solve ITE estimation under composite treatments and composite outcomes, which tackles the data scarcity issue by dynamically sharing information across treatments and outcomes. Our empirical analysis with binary and arbitrary composite treatments and outcomes demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach compared to existing methods.Clinical Relevance-This paper develops a novel methodology, the H-Learner, to estimate individualised treatment effects when clinicians need to consider multiple interventions simultaneously to impact several patient outcomes. By accurately estimating these complex, individualised effects from observational data, this method has the potential to provide clinicians with more precise insights for tailoring treatment strategies, ultimately leading to improved patient care and outcomes in complex clinical scenarios where single interventions and outcomes are insufficient to capture the full picture.",

  "abstract": "Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) is a noninvasive imaging method that reconstructs internal conductivity maps by applying low-frequency electrical currents through surface electrodes and measuring the resulting voltages. While EIT's inverse problem is inherently ill-posed, requiring regularization techniques to stabilize solutions, recent advances in neural networks offer promising alternatives for improving reconstruction accuracy. This study investigates the application of Deep Implicit Layers to EIT reconstruction, combining fixed-point iteration and Newton's method to solve implicit constraints. The forward problem is solved using the finite element method (FEM), and numerical phantoms are employed for training. To ensure a more realistic representation of measurement conditions, contact conductivity was modeled as a random variable sampled from a Gaussian distribution, improving the model's robustness and ability to handle uncertainties. The implicit neural network effectively distinguishes closely positioned objects; however, contrast limitations persist at the boundaries of the phantoms. The results highlight the potential of implicit models in EIT and suggest future improvements through advanced optimization techniques and expansion to 3D thorax reconstruction.",

  "abstract": "Hand movement disorders caused by rheumatoid arthritis (RA) significantly impact patients' quality of life by restricting essential functions such as grasping and pinching. Conventional rehabilitation methods, including therapeutic exercises and splinting, lack precision in addressing individual joint movements and fail to adapt to specific deformities like swan neck and boutonniere. Robotic-assisted rehabilitation has the potential to provide targeted therapy, but existing devices lack the specificity required for deformity management. This study presents a continuum robot-based hand rehabilitation system for RA patients, utilizing a tendon-driven mechanism to enable precise independent joint exercises. The proposed system allows for customized rehabilitation, addressing each deformity with targeted movements while maintaining the stability of unaffected joints. The proposed system is designed in the MATLAB Simscape Multibody environment, and kinematic simulation experiments are conducted for the expected scenarios. Results of these simulations demonstrate the system's feasibility in executing controlled joint movements, filling a critical gap in current therapeutic approaches.",

  "abstract": "Cardiac output (CO) is one of the most significant physiological parameters for cardiovascular monitoring. The gold standard for CO estimation, thermodilution, requires invasive catheterization, limiting its frequent use. Non-invasive methods exist but often lack accuracy. In this study, we applied deep learning to estimate CO based on different input signals including arterial pressure (ART), electrocardiography (ECG), photoplethysmography (PPG), and their combinations. Using publicly available VitalDB database, models were trained and evaluated according to different signals. Performance was measured using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), bias, and limits of agreement (LOA). Of all combinations tested, the triadic model of ART, ECG, and PPG yielded the best performance in MAE (0.66 L/min) and stronger correlation (R = 0.84) with reference CO values. The present study indicates the promise of deep learning for accurate noninvasive estimation of CO. Future research should emphasize the interpretability of the model, scaling up datasets, and facilitating real time applications for increased clinical utility.",

This study utilizes a passive infrared (PIR) sensor array in conjunction with advanced machine learning techniques to estimate respiration rates during sleep. A new algorithm is introduced to classify periodic and non-periodic body movements captured by the PIR sensor array, enabling the identification of activity and sleep segments. To enhance data fusion and reduce noise, a Kalman filter-based algorithm is employed. Respiration rates are estimated during sleep based on subtle, periodic chest movements, achieving an accuracy of 96.8% when compared to a medical-grade chest belt and airflow sensor. These results highlight the potential of PIR sensor arrays for non-invasive sleep monitoring.",

  "abstract": "Medical robotic arm often encounters multi-source and nonlinear errors during the calibration process, making it difficult for traditional mathematical modeling methods to fully characterize system error features, thereby limiting further improvement in calibration accuracy. In this study, a robotic arm parameter error identification model is established, and a calibration method based on an adaptive long short-term memory (ALSTM) neural network is proposed. The method incorporates a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm to optimize the weights of each layer of the LSTM neural network, enabling more effective fitting of robotic arm kinematic errors and ultimately yielding more accurate Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) parameters. To validate the proposed approach, 110 sets of experimental data are collected using the HSR-JR680 robotic arm calibration system. Experimental results demonstrate that the ALSTM model reduces the root mean square error (RMSE) by 23.07%-80.39% compared to traditional calibration methods, and shortens the convergence time by 32.44% compared to a standard LSTM model. The optimized D-H parameters obtained meet the high-precision calibration requirements of medical robotic arm, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Timely response and identification of risk factors are critical components of suicide prevention, enabling appropriate intervention. By applying machine learning to clinical data analysis, predictive models can be developed to classify patients into high- and low-risk groups, which can help prevent loss of life. This study aims to develop a machine learning model to categorize patients based on their risk of suicide attempts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We analyzed data from 301 respondents hospitalized at the Clinic of Psychiatry for either suicidal behavior or non-suicidal reasons. They were divided into two groups according to the presence of suicidal behavior. By using machine learning methods, we analyzed the influence of 18 observed features on the development of suicidal behavior. A predictive model was developed to classify individuals into two risk categories - high and low - for the observed population. The k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm was used to train the model. RESULTS: The kNN-based model achieved a classification accuracy of 87%, with sensitivity at 87%, precision at 90% and an F-score of 85% for the tested sample. CONCLUSIONS: Early identification of risk factors for suicidal behavior remains the most effective strategy for prevention. Classification models may serve as valuable clinical tools for assessing suicide risk, potentially contributing to a reduction in suicide rates in Vojvodina. Expanding the database could improve the functions of the obtained classifier and enable its introduction into medical practice. https://www.europeanreview.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/Graphical-Abstract-27.jpg.",

  "abstract": "Depressive disorder is one of the most common mental health conditions worldwide, with a high risk of suicide and a significant likelihood of becoming chronic. Currently, the diagnosis of depressive disorder relies on clinical interviews and self-report questionnaires, highlighting the need for an objective, digital biomarker-based time-series depression diagnosis model. This study aims to develop a deep learning-based multivariate time-series depression classification model using sleep data collected from wearable devices. The model architecture employs MLSTM-FCN, InceptionTime, and Time-series Transformer, extracting features from a total of ten sleep biomarker candidates to classify depression status. The performance of the models was evaluated, yielding AUC scores of 0.91, 0.82, and 0.78, respectively, with MLSTM-FCN demonstrating the highest performance. Among the sleep biomarker candidates, total time spent in bed, REM sleep latency, and light sleep duration were identified as significant indicators. The proposed model offers a cost-effective and objective method for depression diagnosis and is expected to be applicable to depression patients in community settings in the future.",

  "title": "Pulse Deficit in Photoplethysmography as an Indicator for Atrial Fibrillation.",
  "abstract": "Atrial Fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia in adults and is associated with an increased risk of stroke and other cardiovascular diseases. Early detection of atrial fibrillation is crucial for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes. While electrocardiography is the clinical gold standard for atrial fibrillation detection, it is not suitable for long-term and home monitoring due to its requirement for electrode-skin contact. Photoplethysmography, on the other hand, offers a more convenient alternative for continuous monitoring using wearable devices. This study investigates the reliability of the pulse deficit in photoplethysmography signals as an indicator for atrial fibrillation. We employ a wavelet transformation to enhance the visibility of the pulse deficit in photoplethysmography signals and train a deep neural network to classify atrial fibrillation based on these transformed signals. A five-fold cross validation revealed an average AUC of 0.975 and an F1 score of 0.935, indicating a high level of accuracy and reliability. The networks's predictions are further investigated using the gradient-weighted class activation mapping approach to validate, whether the classification is based on the pulse deficit. Our work succefully proves that the pulse deficit in photoplethysmography signals can serve as a robust indicator for atrial fibrillation. Nevertheless, the impact of other heart rate-related characteristics on the classification could not be entirely excluded.",

  "abstract": "This study presents an innovative approach based on the Robotic Ultrasound Diagnostic System (RUDS) for 3D reconstruction of organs and lesions from sequential 2D ultrasound slices. The RUDS comprises four main components: the Organ Tracking Robot (OTR) for multi-angle probe scanning, the Phantom Posture Robot (PPR) for optimizing probe contact with the abdomen, the Robotic Bed (RB), and the Robotic Supporting Arm (RSA). Leveraging the high flexibility and degrees of freedom in probe manipulation, the OTR controls probe rotation to capture and process continuous 2D slices, enabling precise 3D reconstruction of the kidney and associated lesions. By adjusting scanning speed and contact angles and analyzing spatial relationships within the 3D models, RUDS demonstrates superior accuracy in 3D modeling, supporting preoperative planning in High-Intensity Focused Ultrasound (HIFU) and minimizing risks to non-tumor tissue.Clinical Relevance- This enables precise 3D reconstruction of kidneys and lesions from 2D ultrasound images, supporting HIFU planning and enhancing ultrasound diagnostic accuracy.",

  "abstract": "Rapid Eye Movement (REM) Sleep Behavior Disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by the loss of physiological muscle atonia during REM sleep, often manifesting through dream-enacting behavior. Idiopathic RBD is largely considered a prodromal stage of neurodegenerative diseases, with a conversion rate to overt α-synucleinopathies of up to 96% after 14 years. Currently, the diagnostic procedure relies on time-consuming and labor-intensive inspection of polysomnography (PSG). This study proposes a Machine Learning (ML), stage-agnostic framework for the automatic detection of RBD subjects through unstaged, single-channel EEG sleep data from 58 subjects (32 RBD). The best model achieved 86.21% accuracy, 90.6% sensitivity, and 87.9% F-1 score, demonstrating strong predictive power. This study is the first to explore whole-night EEG data for RBD detection, paving the way for scalable, lightweight clinical decision support systems for early neurodegenerative screening and risk assessment.Clinical relevance- This study presents a lightweight, clinical decision support tool to enhance RBD detection and support early interventions in neurodegenerative diseases.",

  "abstract": "Respiratory disturbances, such as coughing and hyperventilation, are key indicators of deterioration in a patient's condition. This study explores using Symmetric Projection Attractor Reconstruction (SPAR) to improve the accuracy of classification of respiratory disturbances using data from the RESpeck device worn as a plaster on the chest. SPAR reconstructs phase space attractors from time-series data, uncovering complex dynamics overlooked by traditional methods. Deep Learning models were trained and evaluated on labelled Respeck accelerometer data gathered by 152 healthy volunteers and tested on 904-days worth of unseen longitudinal Respeck data from 17 COPD patients. Deep learning models, including CNNs, RNNs, and hybrids, were tested on raw accelerometer data and then on the same dataset with augmented with SPAR features. A SPAR-enhanced CNN-BiLSTM achieved 83.09% accuracy. The analysis of coughing episodes in Respeck datasets gathered by COPD patients in their normal daily lives revealed diurnal coughing patterns consistent with published respiratory health studies. The results demonstrate that cough detection using the Respeck is a viable approach in practice for remote monitoring of respiratory disturbances in patients.Clinical relevance- This study demonstrates the potential of combining deep learning methods with SPAR, applied to accelerometer data from the Respeck patch worn by COPD patients, to enhance the accuracy of respiratory disturbance detection. Accurate cough detection as part of remote respiratory monitoring can reduce reliance on clinical visits and subjective self-reporting. Furthermore, this approach could enable the early identification of exacerbation events and support personalised intervention strategies, ultimately improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs.",

  "title": "Finetuning and Quantization of EEG-Based Foundational BioSignal Models on ECG and PPG Data for Blood Pressure Estimation.",
  "abstract": "Blood pressure (BP) is a key indicator of cardiovascular health. As hypertension remains a global cause of morbidity and mortality, accurate, continuous, and noninvasive BP monitoring is therefore of paramount importance. Photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrocardiography (ECG) can potentially enable continuous BP monitoring, yet training accurate and robust machine learning (ML) models remains challenging due to variability in data quality and patient-specific factors. Recently, multiple research groups explored Electroencephalographic (EEG)-based foundation models and demonstrated their exceptional ability to learn rich temporal resolution. Considering the morphological similarities between different biosignals, the question arises of whether a model pretrained on one modality can effectively be exploited to improve the accuracy of a different signal type. In this work, we take an initial step towards generalized biosignal foundation models by investigating whether model representations learned from abundant EEG data can effectively be transferred to ECG/PPG data solely with fine-tuning, without the need for large-scale additional pre-training, for the BP estimation task. Evaluations on the MIMIC-III and VitalDB datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves near state-of-the-art accuracy for diastolic BP (mean absolute error of 1.57 mmHg) and surpasses by 1.5× the accuracy of prior works for systolic BP (mean absolute error 2.72 mmHg). Additionally, we perform dynamic INT8 quantization, reducing the smallest model size by over 3.5× (from 13.73 MB down to 3.83 MB) while preserving performance, thereby enabling unobtrusive, real-time BP monitoring on resource-constrained wearable devices.Clinical relevance-Our cuffless BP estimation framework addresses the limitations of traditional, intermittent cuff-based devices by exploiting common ECG and PPG signals, enabling more frequent and unobtrusive measurement. With EEG-based pre-training and hardware-friendly quantization, this approach holds promise for low-power, continuous BP monitoring in both clinical and home environments, potentially improving early detection of hypertension and related cardiovascular risks.",

Utilizing a self-supervised contrastive learning methodology with a single wrist-mounted accelerometer sensor, we address the challenges posed by PD patients' abnormal movements. Among 15 PD patients with 3.5 hours of recorded data, our method effectively recognized three unconstrained activities of daily living (ADL) profiles: Ambulation, Sitting, and Standing. The method achieved an average weighted F1-score of 84.85%, surpassing recent studies utilizing deep learning and wearable sensors to monitor individuals' PD activities. The findings highlight the significance of our approach for reliable daily monitoring with a less invasive sensor setup. This advancement promises to aid clinicians in managing PD and personalizing physical therapy.Clinical relevance-Wearable sensor technologies, integrated with advanced deep learning methods, offer a valuable understanding of individuals' PD activity levels. This information can assist clinicians in making informed decisions regarding personalized interventions, such as rehabilitation strategies, to enhance patients' quality of life.",

  "abstract": "Motor Imagery (MI)-based Brain-Computer Interface (MI-BCI) systems induce neuroplasticity, promoting rehabilitation in stroke patients. Existing MI-BCI systems decode bilateral MI actions from Electroencephalogram (EEG) data to facilitate motor recovery. However, such systems offer limited degrees of freedom. Decoding kinematics information, such as movement speed can enhance control and provide a more natural interface with the environment. Decoding speed-related information from unilateral MI tasks is challenging due to the significant spatial overlap of neuronal sources and the inherently low spatial resolution of EEG. To address this, we propose EEGScaler, an end-to-end deep learning framework designed to decode slow v/s fast MI tasks by adaptively scaling EEG samples and electrodes with high discriminative value. EEGScaler leverages a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network to assign scale factors to both samples and electrodes. Spatiotemporal features are subsequently extracted using temporal and depth-wise convolution filters. The model is pre-trained on subject-independent data to learn filter weights, while subject-specific fine-tuning further optimizes the MLP-based scaling mechanism. The EEGScaler model performance is evaluated on 14 healthy subjects' data recorded while performing slow v/s fast unilateral MI tasks. The proposed model achieves an average cross-validated accuracy of 65. 98% for decoding fast v/s slow MI speed tasks, outperforming existing methods by approximately 6%. The subject-specific scaling of samples and electrodes using an end-to-end deep learning model for speed from unilateral MI tasks is novel. By effectively decoding movement speed, EEGScaler enhances the degree of freedom in MI-BCI systems, paving the way for more intuitive and efficient neurorehabilitation applications.Clinical Relevance- This advancement has the potential to improve motor rehabilitation strategies by enabling more precise and adaptive BCI-driven therapy tailored to individual recovery needs.",

  "abstract": "Current AI-based depression assessment apps provide significant advantages for users and clinicians through personalized, accessible mental health support. However, most rely on text or questionnaire-based methods, which are often influenced by user subjectivity, while speech-based detection remains overlooked. In this study, we developed a deep learning based mobile app, MoodEcho, for screening depression using users' audio recordings. MoodEcho is an iOS-based mobile app developed using cloud technology, consisting of three key modules: an audio recording module, a speech-based depression detection module, and a user management module for monitoring and managing detection results. We extracted Mel-spectrogram features from an English depression speech dataset, DAIC-WOZ, to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) incorporating Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) modules, achieving an F1-score of 0.86 on the test set. Besides, we tested a Chinese depression speech dataset collected from clinical interviews using the same SE-CNN model, and the F1-score of the test set was 0.75. MoodEcho implements a dual-language detection capability through a language-adaptive modeling framework, demonstrating its effectiveness as a cross-lingual screening tool. These results show MoodEcho's promising potential as a convenient and reliable tool for clinical decision making, providing valuable support for both users and clinicians.Clinical Relevance- This study presents an AI-based depression detection mobile app as an objective, non-invasive, and accessible tool for early screening, periodic screening, continuous monitoring, and personalized management of depression, ultimately supporting clinical diagnostic and improving diagnostic objectivity.",

  "abstract": "The use of synthetic images in medical imaging Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions has been shown to be beneficial in addressing the limited availability of diverse, unbiased, and representative data. Despite the extensive use of synthetic image generation methods, controlling the semantics variability and context details remains challenging, limiting their effectiveness in producing diverse and representative medical image datasets. In this work, we introduce a scalable semantic and context-conditioned generative model, coined CSG (Context-Semantic Guidance). This dual conditioning approach allows for comprehensive control over both structure and appearance, advancing the synthesis of realistic and diverse ultrasound images. We demonstrate the ability of CSG to generate findings (pathological anomalies) in musculoskeletal (MSK) ultrasound images. Moreover, we test the quality of the synthetic images using a three-fold validation protocol. The results show that the synthetic images generated by CSG improve the performance of semantic segmentation models, exhibit enhanced similarity to real images compared to baseline methods, and are undistinguishable from real images according to a Turing test. Furthermore, we demonstrate an extension of the CSG that allows for the realism of the space of images' variability by synthetically generating augmentations of anatomical geometries and textures.Clinical relevance- The generation of clinically valid synthetic pathological anomalies, such as in musculoskeletal ultrasound images, is a promising use case for developing robust and unbiased AI models. These models have potential applications in cloud-based systems, clinical decision support tools, and the early detection of musculoskeletal diseases.",

  "title": "Spike Train Scalograms (STS): a Deep Learning Classification Pipeline for Neuronal Cell Types.",
  "abstract": "Classifying neuronal cell types is crucial for understanding the intricate circuitry of the cerebral cortex, which comprises diverse specialized neurons essential for brain function. Traditional Machine Learning (ML) approaches rely on manually engineered electrophysiological (EP) features, often overlooking subtle and complex patterns within spike train data. This study introduces a novel Spike Train Scalograms (STS)-based Deep Learning (DL) pipeline that integrates Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) scalograms with pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures to classify neuronal cell types with high accuracy. Utilizing patch-clamp EP recordings from 5,590 murine cortical neurons, the pipeline transforms spike trains into time-frequency representations via CWT, capturing both transient and sustained signal characteristics. These scalograms are then processed by fine-tuned CNN architectures, including InceptionV3, which achieved a balanced accuracy and weighted F1-Score of 90.53% and 90.03%, respectively. The STS pipeline effectively distinguishes between major neuronal types such as Pvalb, Sst, Vip/Lamp5, and Excitatory neurons, even in the presence of class imbalances. Moreover, an explainability analysis using saliency maps and SHAP revealed high correspondence between the DL approach, the ML baseline and biological knowledge of these neuronal types. The results demonstrate that, by combining an advanced spectral analysis with DL techniques, neurons can be classified with high accuracy, employing only two raw sweeps rather then the full stimulation range required by shallow approaches.",

  "title": "Learned k-space Partitioning for Optimized Self-Supervised MRI Reconstruction.",
  "abstract": "Self-supervised magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction methods train deep learning networks without the need for fully sampled reference data. One such approach, self-supervised via data under-sampling (SSDU), partitions under-sampled k-space into two disjoint sets, with a neural network mapping between them. However, SSDU and its variants rely on heuristic k-space partitioning, which may lead to suboptimal performance and necessitates new partitioning schemes when initial under-sampling patterns change. In this work, we propose a novel approach to learn optimal k-space partitioning by modeling a probability distribution which we use for partitioning. Specifically, we employ the LOUPE framework to learn an optimal partitioning probability distribution. Furthermore, we introduce a weighted dual-domain self-supervised loss function that incorporates both k-space and image-space loss terms. Evaluations on the fastMRI dataset demonstrate that our dual-domain learned partitioning method outperforms existing partitioning strategies and adapts to new sampling patterns without requiring hand-picked partitioning methods.Clinical Relevance- Typical clinical MRI protocols are under-sampled and reconstructed using parallel imaging. Self-supervised reconstruction can train directly on under-sampled clinical data, eliminating the need for separately acquired fully sampled datasets.",

  "abstract": "As the global population ages and life expectancy increases, early detection and continuous monitoring of sarcopenia-an age-related decline in muscle mass and strength-are critical for promoting healthy aging. Traditional assessment methods rely on expensive, specialized medical equipment and expert intervention, limiting their practicality for everyday use. To address these challenges, this study proposes a novel vision-based approach for identifying sarcopenia using gait. A total of 92 elderly individuals participated, including 60 patients with sarcopenia and 32 healthy controls. Digital cameras captured each participant's walking motion, from which 2D skeleton sequences were extracted. Our deep learning model, trained on these 2D skeleton sequences along with additional gait-related features, classified sarcopenia and healthy controls with 82.88% sample-wise accuracy and 94.44% subject-wise accuracy on the test dataset.Clinical relevance- This study represents a significant advancement in employing a vision-based approach for the early detection and monitoring of sarcopenia. It provides a promising, accessible solution for at-home muscle health management, eliminating the need for specialized expertise and equipment.",

  "abstract": "This work presents the development and evaluation of a wireless instrumented insole for human gait real-time analysis. Equipped with an embedded processor, the device estimates the Center of Pressure (CoP) and identifies eight gait phases (8GP) in real-time. It can be used in both clinical and non-clinical settings via a simple Wi-Fi-to-USB receiver connected to a host PC.Validation involved three volunteers who walked 64 steps in a straight corridor and completed 16 laps in a room with a force platform. Machine learning models were developed, trained, and embedded in a 32-bit ESP32 microcontroller. Decision trees classified gait phases, while artificial neural networks (ANN) estimated xCoP, yCoP, and vertical ground reaction force (vGRF). Two modeling strategies were tested: subject-specific and cross-subject. The subject-specific models achieved an average F1-score of 0.74, while general models reached 0.61. For CoP and vGRF estimation, the models yielded R values of 0.94 (xCoP), 0.93 (yCoP), and 0.78 (vGRF). The proposed system estimates gait parameters at a 96 Hz sampling rate with fully embedded processing. Based on low-cost, open-source hardware, the insole offers an accessible solution for gait monitoring and integration with assistive rehabilitation technologies across diverse environments, including daily living contexts.",

In this paper, we propose X2Graph, a novel deep learning method that achieves strong performance on small biological tabular datasets. X2Graph leverages external knowledge about the relationships between table columns, such as gene interactions, to convert each sample into a graph structure. This transformation enables the application of standard message passing algorithms for graph modeling. Our X2Graph method demonstrates superior performance compared to existing tree-based and deep learning methods across three cancer subtyping datasets.Clinical relevance- This work advances the application of deep learning solutions to cancer diagnosis, particularly in scenarios where only limited tabular data is available.",

  "title": "Deep Learning-Based Human Joint Localization Using mmWave Radar and Sequential Frame Fusion.",
  "abstract": "Unlike conventional techniques relying typically on RGB and depth cameras, millimeter wave (mmWave) radars, especially Frequency-Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar, have significant advantages in human monitoring. These advantages are more pronounced when detecting human joint positions, as FMCW radars rely solely on collected point cloud data. Compared with camera-based systems, this technology is efficient because it can operate in low-light conditions, and does not present a privacy threat. However, conventional approaches employing FMCW radar, such as voxel-based gathering techniques, still have limitations in optimally capturing spatiotemporal features, making it difficult to detect human joint points with high accuracy. To overcome this obstacle, we propose a novel framework that introduces sequential concatenation of multiple frames in the preprocessing stage to maintain spatiotemporal continuity, thereby improving feature representation. Furthermore, we design a deep learning architecture consisting of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for spatial feature extraction, Transformer for capturing long-term dependencies, and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) for temporal sequence modeling. The proposed approach makes optimal use of spatiotemporal data, improves the accuracy and reliability in detecting human joint positions, and accelerates model convergence. Through experimental validation, this method shows a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.77 cm and a Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) of 2.92 cm between the actual human joint positions and the predicted ones. This reaffirms the effectiveness of the model in estimating human joint positions.",

  "abstract": "The physical load of jumps plays a critical role in injury prevention for volleyball players. However, manual video analysis of jump activities is time-intensive and costly, requiring significant effort and expensive hardware setups. The advent of the inertial measurement unit (IMU) and machine learning algorithms offers a convenient and efficient alternative. Despite this, previous research has largely focused on either jump classification or physical load estimation, leaving a gap in integrated solutions. This study aims to present a pipeline to automatically detect jumps and predict heights using data from a waist-worn IMU. The pipeline leverages a Multi-Stage Temporal Convolutional Network (MS-TCN) to detect jump segments in time-series data and classify the specific jump category. Subsequently, jump heights are estimated using three downstream regression machine learning models based on the identified segments. Our method is verified on a dataset comprising 10 players and 337 jumps. Compared to the result of VERT in height estimation (R-squared = -1.53), a commercial device commonly used in jump landing tasks, our method not only accurately identifies jump activities and their specific types (F1-score = 0.90) but also demonstrates superior performance in height prediction (R-squared = 0.53). This integrated solution offers a promising tool for monitoring physical load and mitigating injury risk in volleyball players.",

  "title": "Functional Ultrasound Imaging in Simulated Brain State Analysis.",
  "abstract": "Functional ultrasound imaging (fUSI) has emerged as a promising non-invasive neuroimaging modality that leverages neurovascular coupling to capture hemodynamic changes associated with neuronal activity. This study investigates the feasibility of fUSI for brain state classification in both healthy and pathological conditions using computational simulations based on the Wilson-Cowan neural mass model. Simulated electrophysiological signals were transformed into fUSI-like traces via convolution with an experimentally derived hemodynamic response function (HRF). Pathological conditions representing Alzheimer's disease (AD) and epilepsy were introduced by modifying excitatory-inhibitory balance parameters. A one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) was trained to classify healthy and pathological states based on either raw electrophysiological data or simulated fUSI signals.Results indicate that while classification performance was superior for electrophysiological data due to its finer temporal resolution, fUSI signals retained sufficient discriminative information for reliable classification, particularly in binary tasks distinguishing control from pathological conditions. Performance was found to be dependent on the progression of pathology, with more severe alterations leading to improved classification accuracy. However, the increased sensitivity of fUSI signals to noise led to some decline in classification performance under high noise conditions. In multiclass tasks distinguishing connectivity states within the same pathology, fUSI exhibited reduced accuracy, indicating challenges in capturing finer network-level distinctions.Clinical relevance-These findings support the potential of fUSI as a cost-effective alternative to traditional neuroimaging for detecting pathological brain states. While some challenges remain in resolving fine-grained connectivity states, fUSI could provide valuable insights into neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy, particularly when combined with advanced noise reduction and signal processing techniques.",

These videos, captured from various heart angles, must be accurately categorized for comprehensive diagnosis, making automated view classification essential. This study develops and evaluates multiple model architectures and feature fusion techniques to classify eleven standard TTE views from video input. We examine both spatial and temporal feature extraction approaches alongside a Dynamic Feature Fusion technique (DFF) that adaptively balances the importance of either feature in analyzing TTE studies. Our results highlight the superior performance of a model architecture utilizing an EfficientNet and Dilated Convolutional Networks, achieving a micro F1 Score of 0.951. Additionally, we leverage a custom cycle detector algorithm to partition a TTE sequence into individual cardiac cycles, i.e., heartbeats, providing consistent input for model training and enabling an ensemble technique for a more reliable prediction. Our findings present valuable insights into effective TTE analysis, identifying the most effective model architecture for echocardiogram interpretation and advancing clinical workflows.Clinical RelevanceThis approach improves echocardiogram view classification, aiding clinicians by streamlining work-flows and reducing errors. The method can also be applied to broader TTE data analysis tasks, such as disease classification, while offering insights into interpretable spatial and temporal patterns.",

  "title": "Hybrid architectures based on Quantum Wavelet Neural Network for Emotion Recognition as a tool to support Personalized Therapies.",
  "abstract": "Human emotions play a fundamental role in social interaction and effective communication between individuals. In the healthcare context, tools based on emotion recognition are promising for therapeutic applications, especially for patients with difficulties in expressing their emotions, who are often unable to communicate the discomfort associated with treatments. This work presents a comparison between hybrid architectures composed of a Quantum Wavelet Neural Network (QWNN) and a Random Forest, using the FER2013 database for training and testing. Our best configuration, with a four-layer QWNN and Random Forest, achieved 70.77% accuracy in the training phase and 81.21% in the testing phase, even using only 34.06% of the features extracted by the QWNN (436 out of 1.280). In addition to its high performance in feature extraction, the QWNN has great potential for synergy with quantum computing due to its ability to represent information at multiple scales and frequencies simultaneously. Finally, the proposed architecture aims to integrate an emotion recognition system based on facial expressions in elderly people (with and without dementia) for personalizing therapies, paving the way for future research that explores Wavelet-based neural networks and Quantum Computing in the health area.",

  "title": "Vigilance Classification for Variable-length EEG Signals using Graph Projections & Transformers.",
  "abstract": "Maintaining situational awareness and alertness is a significant challenge in high-stakes industries such as surveillance, transportation, security, etc. where even brief lapses in attention can have severe consequences. Although machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have improved traditional methods of vigilance classification, the complexity of assessing human vigilance remains unsolved. Current approaches often rely on simplistic binary classification which often fails to capture the nuances of an operator's mental state. To advance our understanding, it is essential to develop more sophisticated models that can categorize vigilance into multiple levels, providing richer insights. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of human performance poses a significant challenge as it generates data of varying sizes. Existing solutions, such as data padding or truncation can introduce biases and compromise the accuracy of the results highlighting the need for more innovative and robust methods. This study proposes a graph embedding based approach that captures human vigilance subtleties through multi-level classification and effectively handles variable-sized EEG signals. Our experimental results demonstrate the superiority of Feather Graph Embedding (FG-Z) for EEG signals, achieving state-of-the-art performance for six-class vigilance classification. Specifically, our model attains an accuracy of 84.165% and F1-score of 83.734% on the training set, and 83.448% accuracy on the testing set, with a peak F1-score of 86.256%. Empirical findings indicate that the combination of FG-Z of EEG graphs with a 1D-CNN Multi-Headed Transformer framework holds great promise for accurate and real-time vigilance monitoring.Clinical relevance- The proposed graph embedding-based vigilance classification framework presents significant implications for both clinical and real-world applications, particularly in domains requiring continuous cognitive monitoring. By effectively modeling variable-length EEG signals and enabling multi-level vigilance assessment, the approach provides a more granular understanding of cognitive states. This advancement facilitates early detection of cognitive fatigue, enhances patient safety in clinical environments, and improves human-machine interactions in critical applications such as neuromonitoring, fatigue detection in medical professionals, and personalized cognitive training interventions.",

  "abstract": "Stroke, a leading cause of global disability and death, casts a significant shadow on countless lives. However, when diagnosed early, some recovery is possible through treatment and robotic rehabilitation. In this paper, an exoskeleton design procedure is discussed to design by considering the kinematic analysis of finger moments to assist the patient in physiotherapy and various Activities of Daily Life (ADL). The design consists of a 3 Degree of Freedom (DOF) planar, linkage-driven, optimized, and underactuated serial linkage mechanism. A three-link model has been developed to keep the design lightweight. The kinematic models of the proposed device were derived to study the design feasibility of the finger for the desired motions. The design of the device is based on the results of a multi-objective optimization algorithm that focuses on the workspace reachability.Clinical relevance- The design plan supports clinically prescribed stroke rehabilitation by providing assistance with finger movements. The lightweight device will reduce therapists' workload, paving the way for longer and stronger therapy sessions, leading to quicker recovery.",

  "abstract": "Surface electromyography (sEMG) has been widely used in human-machine interaction systems for gesture recognition. While high-density EMG systems can enhance recognition accuracy and robustness, their practical deployment remains challenging due to increased hardware complexity and computational demands. In this study, we propose a real-time, high-density EMG-based gesture recognition system that utilizes a 64-channel electrode array and a knowledge distillation-based deep learning approach to enable efficient, wearable deployment. Our system processes sEMG signals in real-time using a lightweight student model, distilled from a VGG-16 teacher model, to balance recognition performance and computational efficiency. The model is further optimized for online streaming scenarios, employing a sliding window mechanism, cold time filtering, and robust calibration strategies to enhance real-world usability. We evaluated the system with 12 participants, achieving an average recognition accuracy of 88.12% across 11 hand gestures while maintaining a processing time of 9.7 ms per segment, meeting real-time requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility of deploying high-density sEMG-based gesture recognition systems in practical, real-time applications.",

  "title": "Atlas-Free Semi-Automatic Segmentation of Sheep Cerebrospinal Fluid Space from MRI.",
  "abstract": "Automatic segmentation enables the rapid, reliable, and reproducible delineation of anatomical structures within the human brain from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. While large animal species, such as sheep, are extensively used in experimental brain research, limited research exists on automating the segmentation of their brain structures, including the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) spaces, compared to that of humans. The development of increasingly automatic segmentation methods for animal brain models has significant implications for experimental research in the management of human pathologies such as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Sheep serve as an ideal model for such advancements due to their similarities to humans in terms of their gyrencephalic brain structure, their long lifespan, and docile nature, which enhance their utility in translational neuroscience research.Here, we present an atlas-free semi-automatic segmentation method for the CSF spaces in sheep, capable of segmenting manually skull-stripped structural MRI images in under one minute. We use the nn-UNet deep learning framework based on convolutional neural networks to train segmentation models on data from four adult sheep brains. When comparing our predictions to manually segmented ground truths, we achieved a high Dice overlap score of 94.05% for the CSF space as a whole, and 75.08% for the intricate ventricular CSF space alone.Clinical relevance-Our atlas-free semi-automatic sheep CSF space segmentation method offers substantial utility in experimental brain research worldwide and holds potential for clinical application upon translation, pending validation on larger clinical datasets.",

  "title": "AI-Powered Detection of Eye Rubbing Behavior for Keratoconus Analysis Using Wearable Devices.",
  "abstract": "Eye rubbing is widely believed to significantly contribute to the development and progression of keratoconus, a potentially blinding disorder of the cornea. Keratoconus involves corneal apical thinning and scarring and can result in painful episodes of swelling of the cornea termed corneal hydrops. As a result, keratoconus can necessitate corneal transplantation for visual recovery and can result in irreversible vision loss in patients who are not candidates for corneal transplantation. Accurately quantifying eye rubbing behavior and rigorously assessing its impact on keratoconus progression are critical needs. Currently, eye rubbing assessment in individuals at risk for keratoconus onset or progression relies mainly on self-reports and occasional clinical observations, which are insufficient to quantify the effects of eye rubbing on keratoconus progression. In this paper, we introduce an innovative deep learning-based analysis framework for real-time, automatic detection of eye rubbing using sensor data from wrist-based wearable devices. To develop and validate the proposed system, a dataset of 1,068 non-overlapping recordings from 9 subjects was built. Our results show that the framework effectively identifies eye rubbing behaviors during normal daily activities, achieving an average F1-score of 93.55% and AUC of 96.23%. This system offers a valuable tool for ophthalmologists and researchers by providing rapid, reliable quantification of eye rubbing behavior in patients.",

  "title": "Fine-Tuning a Pretrained CNN Combined with Self-Attention for Speech Emotion Recognition.",
  "abstract": "Speech emotion recognition (SER) technology has broad applications in healthcare, including enhancing patient monitoring, supporting mental health diagnosis, and improving human-computer interaction in assistive systems. Prior works in SER have combined convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model spatial and temporal dependencies. However, RNNs are computationally expensive and constrained by sequential processing. To address these challenges, this work integrates a self-attention mechanism with a CNN to model temporal relationships. Speech signals are divided into segments and transformed into Mel-spectrogram representations, which serve as input to a pretrained CNN. The CNN captures intra-spectrogram features, while the self-attention mechanism models inter-spectrogram dependencies, enabling the architecture to learn spatial and temporal emotional patterns. The proposed network is fine-tuned on an SER dataset comprising angry, happy, sad, and neutral emotions. It achieves an unweighted average recall of 0.812 in subject-independent cross-validation, demonstrating its ability to discern emotional states in unseen subjects. The integration of self-attention with CNN improves emotion recognition performance and highlights its potential in emotion-sensitive healthcare technologies and other domains where understanding human affect is important.",

  "abstract": "Sleep is an essential component of human physiology, contributing significantly to overall health and quality of life. Accurate sleep staging and disorder detection are crucial for assessing sleep quality. Studies in the literature have proposed PSG-based approaches and machine-learning methods utilizing single-modality signals. However, existing methods often lack multimodal, multilabel frameworks and address sleep stages and disorders classification separately. In this paper, we propose a 1D-Vision Transformer for simultaneous classification of sleep stages and sleep disorders. Our method exploits the sleep disorders' correlation with specific sleep stage patterns and performs a simultaneous identification of a sleep stage and sleep disorder. The model is trained and tested using multimodal-multilabel sensory data (including photoplethysmogram, respiratory flow, and respiratory effort signals). The proposed method shows an overall accuracy (cohen's Kappa) of 78% (0.66) for five-stage sleep classification and 74% (0.58) for sleep apnea classification. Moreover, we analyzed the encoder attention weights to clarify our models' predictions and investigate the influence different features have on the models' outputs. The result shows that identified patterns, such as respiratory troughs and peaks, make a higher contribution to the final classification process.",

  "abstract": "Central aortic pressure is a key hemodynamic parameter to monitor and target in clinical practice. As the gold standard method is highly invasive and conventional noninvasive methods are not long-term compatible or inaccurate, the need for alternative monitoring capabilities arises. Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) is a non-invasive monitoring technique using an electrode belt around the torso. In this paper, EIT recordings from an in-vivo animal model and simultaneously recorded central aortic pressure measurements from invasive catheters are used to train a convolutional neural network predicting aortic pressure curves from EIT voltages. Different parametric representations of the aortic pressure time series are considered to reduce network complexity. A hyperparameter tuning is conducted to optimize the network. Results demonstrate that the estimation of aortic pressure curves by a trained network is feasible even on unknown test data, however, random offsets are observed.",

  "title": "An Integrated Computer Vision and Force Sensing Framework for Automated Fugl-Meyer Hand-Related Assessment Using Artificial Neural Networks.",
  "abstract": "The Fugl-Meyer Assessment (FMA) is widely used to evaluate motor function after stroke in clinical settings; however, its reliance on therapists' visual judgment without objective measurement tools may lead to variable results due to subjectivity. To address this challenge, a portable multi-camera system was developed and integrated with computer vision techniques to track hand position and joint angles during task-related motions. A force-sensing system was additionally incorporated into the assessment tool to measure grasp strength. Data were collected from six healthy subjects (HS), each performing FMA assessment tasks designed to emulate a broad spectrum of motor abilities corresponding to FMA scores of 0, 1, and 2. These data were subsequently used to pre-train an artificial neural network (ANN) for automated FMA scoring, with eight different model architectures evaluated to characterize their performance and identify the optimal approach for this study. The resulting pre-trained model was then tested using data from six stroke patients (SP), whose motor abilities were clinically assessed by a therapist. Among the eight different optimized ANN models pre-trained exclusively on HS data, the top-performing model achieved an average accuracy of 98% across seven hand tests on the HS dataset and maintained 85% accuracy on SP data without additional fine-tuning, indicating effective knowledge transfer. Detailed evaluations revealed that autoencoder-based feature extraction improved accuracy, underscoring the importance of identifying and leveraging key features. Moreover, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based methods effectively captured the temporal dynamics of human motion data. These findings confirm that the developed computer vision and force-sensing system effectively captures hand motions and grasp strength. Moreover, the results establish a critical foundation for verifying key assumptions that learned representations from HS data, through pre-trained and optimized ANN structures, can be transferred to clinical SP data-mitigating common challenges associated with collecting patient data in clinical studies. This verification paves the way for future work, such as exploring additional fine-tuning strategies to enhance accuracy, applying advanced data augmentation techniques, incorporating larger patient datasets, and employing transfer learning for continuous scoring rather than discrete values for more refined assessments.",

  "abstract": "Predicting chemotherapy response in metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) remains challenging due to the lack of reliable biomarkers. We developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven pathomics approach that integrates multicenter data and provides visual explanations to enhance interpretability. Using transfer learning and attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL), our deep learning algorithm automatically extracted predictive features from whole slide images (WSIs). The model was pretrained on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) to identify survival-related histopathological patterns and fine-tuned on a multicenter mCRC cohort to classify patients as chemotherapy-sensitive or resistant.Compared to a baseline model trained solely on mCRC data, our approach improved model stability, reduced variability, and increased predictive accuracy in the holdout test set achieving a nearly 15% improvement in area under the curve (AUC: 0.54 to 0.68). High attention-weighted tile visualizations highlighted tumor microenvironment features potentially linked to chemotherapy resistance, offering insights for both clinical decision-making and biological research.Clinical relevance- This study demonstrates the feasibility of using AI and digital pathology, through transfer learning, to enhance chemotherapy response prediction in mCRC. By improving interpretability and incorporating multicenter data, our approach offers insights that could inform treatment strategies. Although further refinement is needed for clinical deployment, this framework lays the foundation for integrating multi-omics data to achieve AI-powered personalized oncology care.",

  "abstract": "Accurate monitoring of the respiratory rate (RR) is crucial for early disease detection and effective health assessment. Real-world applications often face challenges such as motion artifacts and environmental noise. Robust signal fusion techniques are essential to enhance data reliability and to ensure that signals are accurate despite external disturbances.To address these challenges, we present an integrated respiratory rate detection system for vehicle drivers, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNN) and bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM)-based models for non-invasive health monitoring. We detect the RR with the four sensors: two accelerometers, a piezoelectric sensor, and an RGB camera. We use a chest belt to record the ground truth. The system tracks the driver's RR and handles challenges such as motion artifacts and environmental noise. Tested on 15 participants, the BiLSTM-based signal fusion model achieves F = 0.68, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting respiratory patterns. The mobile interface visualizes health data and uses color-coded alerts.In contrast to wearables, in-vehicle health recording supports individualized long-term monitoring without any user interaction and enhances data stability. Potential applications are preventive healthcare, remote monitoring, and telemedicine. Future work will focus on optimizing sensor fusion and expanding the model's capabilities to support health analytics in intelligent transportation systems.",

  "title": "Atrial Fibrillation Detection from Ambulatory ECG with Accelerometry Contextualisation: A Semi-Supervised Learning Approach.",
  "abstract": "Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a common cardiac arrhythmia causing severe complications if left untreated. Due to its sporadic nature, early detection often requires longitudinal ambulatory electrocardiogram (ECG) screening. Recently, deep learning (DL) has gained prominence in analysing long-term ECG and automating AF detection. However, like any medical classification problem, obtaining diverse labelled ECG data for DL model training is expensive and time-consuming. This paper proposes a semi-supervised learning (SSL) based AF detection model employing a variational auto-encoder (VAE). It leverages varying amounts of labelled and unlabelled ECG data to optimise the AF detection performance on ambulatory ECG. As ambulatory contexts under free-living conditions influence ECG recordings, we incorporate context via accelerometry data and experiment with its influence on model performance. The proposed SSL model was trained on ECG data from 72,003 unique patients and can classify between sinus rhythms, AF, and other arrhythmias. Experimental results on unseen test dataset and the publicly available CACHET-CADB dataset clearly demonstrate the model's generalisability, achieving an accuracy of over 91% with just 20% of the training set being labelled. With extensive experiments, our study exhibits the ability of SSL to improve AF detection from ambulatory ECG using small amounts of labelled data.",

  "abstract": "We propose a Topomap-based EEG decoding framework for distinguishing pictorial Imagination from Perception. By converting each trial's EEG signals into dense sequences of scalp voltage maps at short time intervals, our approach captures crucial spatiotemporal patterns that standard methods may overlook. We then apply a CNN with squeeze-and-excitation (SE) blocks to these Topomap \"frames,\" enabling direct learning of both spatial topographies and rapid temporal fluctuations. Despite using only one trial per subject to simulate a data-scarce scenario, our model achieves 95.1% accuracy under a leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation scheme. Results indicate clear neural distinctions between Imagination and Perception states, reflecting focused brain-region engagement during visual recall. In addition to confirming the viability of Topomaps as EEG feature representations, this study underscores their potential generalizability. We anticipate future extensions incorporating other modalities (orthographic, audio) and more advanced deep architectures will further expand the utility and robustness of this approach for brain-computer interface (BCI) applications.Clinical relevance- This framework offers a robust method for accurately distinguishing visual Imagination from Perception, even in data-scarce scenarios.

  "title": "Leveraging Self-Supervised Learning Methods for Remote Screening of Subjects with Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation.",
  "abstract": "The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into clinical research has great potential to reveal patterns that are difficult for humans to detect, creating impactful connections between inputs and clinical outcomes. However, these methods often require large amounts of labeled data, which can be difficult to obtain in healthcare due to strict privacy laws and the need for experts to annotate data. This requirement creates a bottleneck when investigating unexplored clinical questions. This study explores the application of Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) as a way to obtain preliminary results from clinical studies with limited sized cohorts. To assess our approach, we focus on an underexplored clinical task: screening subjects for Paroxysmal Atrial Fibrillation (P-AF) using remote monitoring, single-lead ECG signals captured during normal sinus rhythm. We evaluate state-of-the-art SSL methods alongside supervised learning approaches, where SSL outperforms supervised learning in this task of interest. More importantly, it prevents misleading conclusions that may arise from poor performance in the latter paradigm when dealing with limited cohort settings.Clinical relevance- This study illustrates how self-supervised learning (SSL) provides robust preliminary studies with minimal labeled data. By leveraging SSL, researchers can assess the feasibility of clinical questions before committing to extensive data collection efforts. In addition, our findings demonstrate that P-AF can be effectively detected from normal sinus rhythm recordings captured by wearable devices. This capability paves the way for scalable population screening, potentially transforming early diagnosis and intervention strategies in clinical practice.",

  "title": "Performance Evaluation of Transfer Learning Based Medical Image Classification Techniques for Disease Detection.",
  "abstract": "Medical image classification plays an increasingly vital role in identifying various diseases by classifying medical images, such as X-rays, MRIs and CT scans, into different categories based on their features. In recent years, deep learning techniques have attracted significant attention in medical image classification. However, it is usually infeasible to train an entire large deep learning model from scratch. To address this issue, one of the solutions is the transfer learning (TL) technique, where a pre-trained model is reused for a new task. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of TL techniques for medical image classification using deep convolutional neural networks. We evaluate six pre-trained models (AlexNet, VGG16, ResNet18, ResNet34, ResNet50, and InceptionV3) on a custom chest X-ray dataset for disease detection. The experimental results demonstrate that InceptionV3 consistently outperforms other models across all the standard metrics. The ResNet family shows progressively better performance with increasing depth, whereas VGG16 and AlexNet perform reasonably well but with lower accuracy. In addition, we also conduct uncertainty analysis and runtime comparison to assess the robustness and computational efficiency of these models. Our findings reveal that TL is beneficial in most cases, especially with limited data, but the extent of improvement depends on several factors such as model architecture, dataset size, and domain similarity between source and target tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that with a well-trained feature extractor, only a lightweight feedforward model is enough to provide efficient prediction. As such, this study contributes to the understanding of TL in medical image classification, and provides insights for selecting appropriate models based on specific requirements.",

  "title": "Improving Omics-Based Classification: The Role of Feature Selection and Synthetic Data Generation.",
  "abstract": "Given the increasing complexity of omics datasets, a key challenge is not only improving classification performance but also enhancing the transparency and reliability of model decisions. Effective model performance and feature selection are fundamental for explainability and reliability. In many cases, high-dimensional omics datasets suffer from limited number of samples due to clinical constraints, patient conditions, phenotypes rarity and others conditions. Current omics-based classification models often suffer from narrow interpretability, making it difficult to discern meaningful insights where trust and reproducibility are critical. This study presents a machine learning-based classification framework that integrates feature selection with data augmentation techniques to achieve high-standard classification accuracy while ensuring better interpretability. Using the publicly available dataset E-MTAB-8026, we explore a bootstrap analysis in six binary classification scenarios to evaluate the proposed model's behaviour. We show that the proposed pipeline yields cross-validated perfomance on small dataset that is conserved when the trained classifier is applied to a larger test set. Our findings emphasize the fundamental balance between accuracy and feature selection, highlighting the positive effect of introducing synthetic data for better generalization, even in scenarios with very limited samples availability.Clinical relevance- The proposed framework addresses a critical challenge in omics-based disease classification by improving model interpretability while maintaining high classification performance. By providing a more explainable data-driven approach, this study contributes to the development of reliable and reproducible diagnostic tools that can support clinical decision-making.",

  "title": "Resolution Enhancement of Prostate 3D MRI and Ultrasound Using Implicit Neural Representations.",
  "abstract": "Prostate Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and ultrasound (US) imaging play a crucial role in the diagnosis and management of prostate diseases. However, spatial and axial resolution limitations can hinder the accurate detection of lesions, affecting clinical decision-making. Traditional deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) methods, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have demonstrated success in enhancing medical image quality; however, they often suffer from high computational costs and rigid grid-based representations. In this work, we explore the application of Implicit Neural Representations (INRs), specifically Sinusoidal Representation Networks (SIREN), for super-resolution reconstruction of prostate MRI and US images. While INRs leverage continuous function representations to enhance spatial and axial resolution and preserve fine anatomical structures, our work focuses on the novel application of SIREN to this specific medical imaging task. To further improve reconstruction quality, we propose a hybrid loss function combining Mean Square Error (MSE) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM). Experimental results demonstrate that our approach effectively restores high-resolution details, improving lesion visibility and aiding radiologists in more accurate diagnosis.Clinical Relevance- Limitations in the spatial and axial resolution of prostate MRI and US can hinder accurate lesion detection, leading to diagnostic uncertainty and the need for additional imaging studies or biopsies. This increases healthcare costs and patient burden. The proposed super-resolution approach using Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) enhances image quality while preserving fine anatomical structures, enabling radiologists to extract more information from existing scans. By improving lesion visibility and diagnostic accuracy, this method has the potential to reduce the need for additional procedures, ultimately leading to cost savings and improved patient outcomes.",

  "title": "Patient-Level Modeling and Classification of ST-segment in 12-Lead Electrocardiogram for Automated Myocardial Ischemia Detection.",
  "abstract": "The earliest manifestations of myocardial ischemia have been reported in the ST-segment. Hence, accurate detection of ST-segment changes (ST elevation (STE) and ST depression (STD)) in 12-lead ECG recordings is essential for diagnosing myocardial ischemia. This study proposes a clinically relevant patient-level ST-segment classification approach using 12-lead ECG recordings, suitable for varied-length recordings. The ST-segment is modeled using least-squares polynomial regression, resulting in an STp segment. Handcrafted features are then extracted from this segment and its amplitude envelope. Seven ensemble machine learning classifiers-balanced random forest (BRF), balanced bagging classifier with a support vector machine (BBC-SVM) using a radial basis function kernel, and BBC with a multi-layer perceptron (BBC-MLP), gradient boosting (GB), adaptive boosting (AB), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and light gradient boosting (LGB))-effective at handling class imbalance, are evaluated and compared. The LGB classifier outperformed the others, achieving F1 scores of 0.94 (Normal), 0.86 (STD), and 0.72 (STE), resulting in an overall average of 0.84 in the 12-lead case. A specific six-lead combination (I, II, aVL, V1, V4, and V6) achieved an average F1 score of 0.83. Additionally, the proposed approach was validated on the European ST-T database and yielded intra-patient average F1 scores ranging from 0.87 to 1. The proposed approach demonstrated state-of-the-art performance while ensuring clinical understanding and model transparency.Clinical relevance- This study presents a clinically interpretable and effective ST-segment classification framework at the patient-level, using handcrafted features derived from 12-lead ECGs. While achieving good performance in distinguishing Normal, STD, and STE, the approach holds potential for clinical application, assisting cardiologists in the detection and decision-making of ST-segment changes.",

  "abstract": "Intracranial pressure (ICP) signal recordings are often riddled with artifacts. While multiple methods have been proposed to automatically detect such artifacts, they often lack tools to handle detected inconsistencies. Simple removal of the invalid fragment may be the safest option but some derivative metrics require computation over long time windows and cannot accept missing samples within the calculation horizon. We aimed to test the feasibility of using deep learning models to accurately impute missing data in the ICP signal. Different signal imputation methods were used in the context of ICP monitoring in neurocrital care patients. Standard statistical approach called seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) modeling was used as a baseline and compared with novel neural network models: bidirectional recurrent network (BRITS), variational autoencoder (VAE), and self-attention model (SAITS). The models aimed to reconstruct missing data using clean signals before and after the gap and were assessed based on maximum length of the missing fragment, quality of the reconstruction, and applicability in online processing. While SARIMA allows for capturing of the periodicity of the data, the models do not take into account the signal after the artifact, leading to misalignment. The SAITS model outperforms SARIMA and the other models in all considered metrics. With the use of proper modern machine learning techniques, it is possible to fill in short missing parts to improve the reliability of the ICP signal. These methods, however, are not suited for longer gaps.",

  "abstract": "Accurate ovulation prediction is crucial for fertility management. Although calendar-based methods are widely used, they are effective only for regular cycles. Furthermore, machine learning-based ovulation prediction studies obtained declined accuracy for irregular cycles and became less reliable. To address this limitation, we propose an ovulation prediction framework that (i) generates novel features by integrating temporal heart rate variability (HRV) patterns from ECG with temporal temperature values and 10-min resolution temperature features, and (ii) employs a light gradient boosting machine (LGBM). Participants wore an ECG device and a temperature sensor during sleep. The prediction focused on a 8-day period, covering 5 days before to 2 days after ovulation, to capture key physiological changes in the fertile window and improve prediction performance. The proposed framework obtained an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.73 and their performance was superior performance when compared with various machine and deep learning models. Notably, the model excelled in predicting ovulation for irregular cycles, achieving AUROC of 0.84 in the highly irregular group and 0.88 in the undefined group. These findings highlight the importance of temporal segmentation and multimodal feature integration for enhanced ovulation prediction. The proposed framework accurately predicts the ovulation date up to 5 days in advance for premenopausal women, significantly enhancing fertility management.",

  "abstract": "With a growing older population and a shortage of aged care staff, there is a pressing need for technology solutions to support the independent living of older adults in their own homes, facilitating aging in place. Internet of Things (IoT)-based technologies present a promising solution through the use of distributed sensors to facilitate daily activity monitoring and deliver timely alerts to caregivers and clinicians. This study investigates the integration of wearable and object-based IoT motion sensors to accurately recognize human activities that are essential for assessing the independent living ability of older adults. Real-world data was collected from 17 key daily activities in a home setting, using 30 wearable and object motion sensors. We then implemented several machine learning algorithms to classify the activities based on the sensor data, focusing on enhanced accuracy and system scalability.Our findings demonstrate that the Random Forest (RF) classification algorithm can achieve an accuracy of 90.63% in recognizing the activities using 11 wearable sensors. When combined with 19 object sensors, the accuracy improves to 97.88%. To enhance scalability and cost-effectiveness, we optimized the sensor configuration, reducing the number of required sensors by 57% (from 30 to 13) without compromising activity recognition performance. The proposed approach offers a robust mechanism to monitor daily activities that can be used to provide real-time alerts to caregivers and clinicians. This capability supports timely assistance and interventions, ultimately promoting the well-being and independence of older adults in their own homes.",

  "title": "Alignment-Guided Forward-Distortion Model for Deep Unsupervised Correction of Susceptibility Artifacts in EPI.",
  "abstract": "In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), susceptibility-induced distortions pose a significant challenge for images acquired using echo planar imaging (EPI). Classical methods use two EPI images acquired in reverse phaseencoding (PE) directions to correct susceptibility artifacts. However, these methods suffer from long computation times, making them impractical for clinical usage. Recently, deep learning-based approaches have been proposed to enable a leap in computation efficiency for EPI susceptibility artifact correction. A vital consideration in reverse-PE-based correction is the need to take into account any potential subject motion between reversed-PE acquisitions. In this work, we propose an alignment-guided forward distortion network (agFD-Net) that accounts for subject motion during correction of susceptibility artifacts. Similar to its predecessor FD-Net, agFD-Net is trained in a physics-driven unsupervised fashion to estimate a single corrected image and a displacement field. In agFD-Net, a new pre-trained alignment network called AlignNet is plugged into the network architecture to facilitate motion correction. The results on experimental NIH dataset featuring realistic levels of motion demonstrate that agFD-Net provides rapid and high-fidelity artifact correction, while successfully accounting for subject motion.Clinical Relevance-EPI is the most commonly used sequence for diffusion MRI and functional MRI. While susceptibility artifacts in EPI require correction before any downstream evaluation, the long computation time of classical correction methods make them impractical for use in clinical settings. The proposed agFD-Net provides more than two orders of magnitude speed up in computational efficiency, making it a highly promising approach for use in clinical settings.",

  "abstract": "Accurate segmentation of the mandibular canal (MC) is crucial in maxillofacial surgical planning to prevent nerve damage and improve treatment outcomes. However, manual MC segmentation from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) images is time-consuming and prone to observer variability. While CNN-based segmentation models have shown promise in automating this process, they often suffer from spatial discontinuities and low surface quality due to their reliance on voxel-wise classification. To address these limitations, we propose MCVoxel2MeshNet, a neural implicit representation (NIR)-based voxel-to-mesh generation network for MC segmentation in CBCT images. Unlike conventional CNN-based methods, our approach models the MC surface as a continuous function, enabling seamless segmentation and high-fidelity 3D mesh generation. Additionally, we introduce a modality-aware loss function that enforces multi-level supervision at the mask, grid, point, and mesh levels, improving segmentation accuracy and mesh smoothness. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that MCVoxel2MeshNet outperforms existing segmentation networks, achieving the highest Dice Score (DS) of 0.85 ± 0.06 % and Chamfer Distance (CD) of 1.97 ± 1.85 mm. Furthermore, our method produces continuous, noise-free MC structures, effectively eliminating false positives and artifacts. These results highlight the potential of MCVoxel2MeshNet for accurate and robust MC segmentation, paving the way for enhanced computer-assisted maxillofacial surgical planning.",

In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate both the extraction of features from EMG data and the development of machine learning models for decoding human motion with minimal human intervention. More specifically, we compare LLM extracted features and their corresponding motion decoding models against those developed using manually developed code. Our results indicate that LLM extracted features and their corresponding trained models achieve performance comparable to traditional methods, demonstrating the potential of accelerating research and scientific investigations with AI-driven biosignal processing. This study highlights LLMs' capabilities and limitations in replacing manual coding for developing muscle-machine interfaces and provides insights into their integration into biomedical signal analysis workflows.",

Real-time experiments with five healthy subjects demonstrated high to very high correlations between predictions and ground truth (r =0.81, r = 0.96). These promising results highlight the potential of this approach to transform clinical gait analysis by reducing reliance on expensive and fixed force-plate systems. Future work will focus on validating the method with pathological gait datasets to ensure broader applicability and advancing its integration into diverse clinical environments for real-time feedback and analysis.",

  "abstract": "The use of neuroimaging data to estimate brain age plays a critical role in understanding normative brain development and the progression of neurological disorders. While deep learning models based on fMRI data have achieved success in this field, most studies rely on spatial maps or functional connectivity as input features. Despite significant progress, these methods often lose fine-grained information about the brain. Therefore, our study proposes a novel approach that directly utilizes unsegmented fMRI data as input features to better leverage the spatiotemporal information of fMRI data. Our method integrates convolutional neural networks (CNN) and transformer models to capture spatial and temporal features simultaneously. At the final stage, the extracted spatiotemporal features are fed into a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) for age prediction. Experimental results demonstrate the outstanding performance of our model in age prediction tasks and identify regions significantly impacting age regression tasks through an explainability method, offering new insights and methodologies for future neuroimaging research.",

  "abstract": "The 3D shape measurement of internal organs is crucial for both diagnosis and surgery using endoscopy and colonoscopy. While various attempts have been made to develop 3D endoscopic systems, active one-shot scanning methods are particularly advantageous as they integrate seamlessly with existing systems. However, these methods suffer from issues such as noise and reduced accuracy due to unstable pattern detection. To address these challenges, we propose an approach based on neural signed distance field (neural SDF), incorporating a pattern reflection model. Our method, while utilizing structured light, eliminates the need for decoding by modeling structured light patterns as point light sources with high-frequency illumination characteristics. By employing differentiable rendering to minimize the difference between rendered and actual images, our approach enables the simultaneous estimation of object shape, surface reflection properties (including texture and shading), and camera pose. Furthermore, we extend our method to endoscopic Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM), where traditional feature-based approaches fail due to the lack of distinct shape and texture features in internal organs by sequentially optimizing camera pose through differentiable rendering for each frame, achieving robust wide-area shape reconstruction. Experimental validation using rendered images of a polygon model of an actural colon demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in comparison to previous methods.Clinical relevance- Endoscopic shape measurement is relevant to cancer diagnosis, computer-assisted interventions, and making depth-annotation for machine learning training data.",

  "abstract": "This paper explores the use of adversarial debiasing algorithms to mitigate bias in ultrasound imaging datasets, focusing on breast and lung images. The study evaluates fairness metrics like area under the curve (AUC), False Positive Rate (FPR), False Negative Rate (FNR), and demographic parity to assess the impact of debiasing using the recently published MEDFAIR framework. While debiasing improves fairness overall, disparities remain in certain subgroups, such as age in the breast dataset and sex in the lung dataset. The paper also compares artificial intelligence (AI) models (ResNet18, AlexNet, VGG16, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121), revealing differences in susceptibility to bias and effectiveness post-debiasing. These findings underscore the challenges of achieving full fairness in AI-driven medical imaging and highlight the need for continued refinement of debiasing methods to ensure equitable outcomes across diverse patient populations.",

  "abstract": "Dementia is a progressive condition that impairs an individual's cognitive health and daily functioning, with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) often serving as its precursor. The prediction of MCI-to-dementia conversion has been well studied, but previous studies have almost always focused on traditional Machine Learning (ML)-based methods that require sharing sensitive clinical information to train predictive models. This study proposes a privacy-enhancing solution using Federated Learning (FL) to train predictive models for MCI-to-dementia conversion without sharing sensitive data, leveraging socio-demographic and cognitive measures. We simulated and compared two network architectures, Peer-To-Peer (P2P) and client-server, to enable collaborative learning. Our results demonstrated that FL had comparable predictive performance to centralized ML, and each clinical site showed similar performance without sharing local data. Moreover, the predictive performance of FL models was superior to site-specific models trained without collaboration. This work highlights that FL can eliminate the need for data sharing without compromising model efficacy.",

  "title": "Fine-Tuning of Wav2Vec 2.0 for Multimodal Classification of Abnormal Heart Sounds.",
  "abstract": "Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death, resulting in approximately 17.9 million deaths every year. Treatment of CVDs is most effective when detected early, creating a need for accurate and inexpensive pre-screening methods. Recently, deep learning has been explored to classify abnormal heart sounds indicative of CVDs using phonocardiogram (PCG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. However, due to limited synchronised PCG and ECG data, state-of-the-art (SOTA) architectures, such as transformers, have not seen much use within this domain. This work explores the use of traditional signal processing, along with denoising diffusion models WaveGrad and DiffWave, to create an augmented dataset that is used to fine-tune a Wav2Vec 2.0-based classifier. The proposed methods achieve greater than state-of-the-art accuracy, unweighted average recall, sensitivity, specificity and Matthew's correlation coefficient of 93.14% and 92.21%, 93.35%, 90.10% and 0.838, respectively, in the Computing in Cardiology (CinC) 2016 training-a data which consists of synchronised PCG and ECG signals. These methods also achieved 92.98%, 92.48%, 93.63%, 92.48%, and 0.8238 when trained on all CinC databases utilising only PCG signals, which is also greater performance than SOTA methods. These results demonstrate the performance of fine-tuning self-supervised transformer-based models when trained on larger amounts of data, which an augmented dataset can supplement.",

  "abstract": "The rising global prevalence of heart disease necessitates early detection for improved diagnosis and treatments. Automated echocardiography robotic systems are revolutionizing cardiology by enhancing diagnostic accuracy and efficiency. These systems integrate real-time image acquisition and processing to navigate patient anatomy and adapt imaging techniques dynamically without human intervention. Accurate cardiac view classification is vital for capturing diagnostically relevant images, forming the basis for subsequent automated disease detection and diagnosis. Although deep learning has emerged as a powerful tool for medical image analysis, its application in echocardiography remains limited due to the complexity of multi-view echocardiography imaging. The proposed system leverages deep learning models, specifically convolutional neural networks, trained on a diverse dataset of echocardiographic images to distinguish standard cardiac views, including the parasternal long-axis, parasternal short-axis, and apical four-chamber views. This capability enables the robotic system to autonomously navigate patient anatomy and optimize image acquisition in real time, minimizing operator dependency and ensuring imaging consistency. The long-term objective of this study is to develop a fully autonomous robotic system capable of early and accurate cardiovascular disease diagnosis, ultimately reducing diagnostic delays and improving patient outcomes.",

  "abstract": "Automated epileptic seizure detection from electroencephalogram (EEG) remains challenging due to significant individual differences in EEG patterns across patients. While existing studies achieve high accuracy with patient-specific approaches, they face difficulties in generalizing to new patients. To address this, we propose a detection framework combining domain adversarial training with a convolutional neural network (CNN) and a bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM). First, the CNN extracts local patient-invariant features through domain adversarial training, which optimizes seizure detection accuracy while minimizing patient-specific characteristics. Then, the BiLSTM captures temporal dependencies in the extracted features to model seizure evolution patterns. Evaluation using EEG recordings from 20 patients with focal epilepsy demonstrated superior performance over non-adversarial methods, achieving high detection accuracy across different patients. The integration of adversarial training with temporal modeling enables robust cross-patient seizure detection.",

  "title": "Lung Nodule Malignancy Classification On 3D CT Images Using a Cosine Similarity-Enhanced Graph Attention Network.",
  "abstract": "Lung cancer remains a major contributor to global cancer-related deaths, largely due to diagnoses occurring at advanced stages. Accurately distinguishing between benign and malignant pulmonary nodules plays a pivotal role in facilitating early detection and timely intervention. To address the limitations of traditional methods that consider only individual CT slices and suffer from high false-positive rates, this work proposes an end-to-end patient-level classification framework for pulmonary nodule malignancy based on a Cosine Similarity-Enhanced Graph Attention Network (CSEGAT). The proposed method utilizes a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to derive features from individual slices, which are subsequently employed as node attributes within the constructed graph. Edges are constructed based on both spatial adjacency and cosine similarity, enabling the graph neural network to capture spatial and contextual relationships between slices. Each patient is represented as a graph, and the CSEGAT model is employed for patient-level benign/malignant classification. By introducing a similarity-enhanced attention mechanism, CSEGAT dynamically adjusts edge weights, thereby improving information propagation and classification performance. This method enables end-to-end learning from slice-level feature extraction to patient-level diagnosis, eliminating the need for complex feature engineering while enhancing diagnostic accuracy and reducing the false-positive rate. Experimental findings indicate that the proposed method attains a peak testing accuracy of 90.85%, accompanied by an average sensitivity of 88.84% and an average specificity of 90.65%. Experimental results on the LIDC-IDRI dataset demonstrate that CSEGAT outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC, providing a robust solution for pulmonary nodule diagnosis.",

  "title": "Exploring the Joint Effect of Resampling Techniques and Cross-Validation for Preterm Birth Prediction.",
  "abstract": "Imbalanced datasets are common in real-world classification problems, such as predicting premature birth. Many machine learning algorithms, designed for balanced data, may produce biased predictions when applied to imbalanced datasets. In preterm birth prediction, where preterm cases are much less frequent than full-term, this imbalance may significantly impact model performance. Resampling techniques like oversampling the minority class or undersampling the majority class are key to improving accuracy and fairness. Previous studies have struggled with data handling, often leading to overly optimistic results, which this paper aims to address. The main objective is to compare various undersampling, oversampling, and ensemble techniques, with and without Cross-Validation (CV). For this purpose, the Term-Preterm Electrohysterogram (EHG) Database (TPEHG DB) has been used. Results show that ensemble techniques perform the most consistently. It has been found that the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE), Cluster-Based Undersampling (Cluster Centroids), and Ranked Minority Oversampling in boosting (RAMOBoost) yield the best overall performance.Clinical relevance - The present work may be considered as the first step in developing robust resampling tool for dealing with class imbalance in the prediction of preterm birth. The preliminary results indicate that machine learning and resampling techniques can aid in the research of preterm delivery prognosis, which may have significant clinical relevance for both healthcare providers and patients.",

  "abstract": "Synthetic electrocardiograms (ECGs), obtained with Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), are currently used to support the training of other AI algorithms, most often decision support systems, by augmenting the dataset for the minority classes. In this study, we proposed a Text-to-ECG (T2ECG) framework, which could generate synthetic ECG beats from textual data. The framework made use of two components. The first, Bio_ClinicalBERT, produced an embedded vector from the input text (e.g., \"left ventricular hypertrophy\"). Then, a second component leveraged such representation to generate a 12-lead ECG heartbeat by means of a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with gradient penalty. The training was performed on the PTB-XL dataset, freely available on Physionet. The framework was designed to generate five different diagnostic classes: i) normal sinus rhythm; ii) inferior myocardial infarction (IMI); iii) antero-septal myocardial infarction (ASMI); iv) left anterior fascicular block (LAFB); and v) left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). The realism of the generated signals was assessed through three different methodologies, involving both visual inspection and quantitative analyses. Our results show that the T2ECG framework was able to generate heartbeats of sufficient quality, except for the the ASMI class. In conclusion, the framework proposed does not only support data augmentation but also facilitates the creation of ECGs by non-technical users, offering a textual interface to the GenAI model.",

This research utilizes DenseNet-121 to automate the detection of metastatic tissue using the CAMELYON17 dataset, along with some data augmentation techniques to improve model generalization. The results show that DenseNet-121 with data augmentation outperforms ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 in terms of accuracy and F1-score in detecting metastatic tissue, achieving impressive results with a testing accuracy of 0.98 and an F1-score of 0.98, which is higher than previous state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the model's performance was tested on the CAMELYON16 dataset, and it still maintained relatively high accuracy on previously unseen images.

  "abstract": "Cavity detection in dental X-rays is essential for early diagnosis and treatment planning, yet traditional deep learning approaches often rely on binary classification of entire images, overlooking localized analysis. This study introduces a multi-scale AI-assisted approach for both classification and detection, leveraging the Ultralytics YOLO11 framework to compare image-level and tooth-level methodologies. The single-tooth classification model achieved a test accuracy of 0.854, while panoramic classification performed slightly better at 0.864. For cavity detection, the tooth-level model outperformed the panoramic approach, with the test set achieving mAP@50 of 0.845 compared to 0.669, with significantly higher recall (0.743 vs. 0.394), highlighting challenges in full-image localization. These findings emphasize the trade-offs between segmentation-based and direct image-based approaches, demonstrating the advantages of tooth-level analysis for improved detection accuracy. Future work will refine segmentation techniques, expand clinical datasets, and validate performance across varied imaging conditions.",

  "abstract": "Late-onset sepsis affects between 10 to 25% of very premature babies, standing as a primary contributor to neonatal mortality. In this paper, we present an innovative approach that relies solely on the analysis of newborns' motion, derived from the processing of videos acquired in neonatal intensive care units, for several consecutive days. Among a group of 16 very premature newborns, consisting of 8 sepsis and 8 control subjects, we initially extract 14 distinct motion features, in a total of 2636 hours of video recordings. These features are processed through a fusion of fuzzy spatio-temporal coding and smoothed principal component analysis. It leads to 16 trajectories, one per newborn, positioned differently in a 2D plane. They are then compared across parameters such as position, speed, and acceleration. Our findings underscore significant differences in 8 trajectory parameters between sepsis and control newborns. Finally, unsupervised classification was used to separate infected and healthy newborns using these parameters, achieving an accuracy of 81.3%.Clinical relevance- This approach offers a non invasive video-based motion method for early sepsis detection in premature newborns, enabling timely interventions and potentially improving neonatal outcomes.",

While deep learning methods have shown advantages, they typically rely on fully sampled reference data, which are difficult to obtain and time-consuming. To address this issue, we propose a self-supervised method based on two parallel reconstruction networks. These parallel networks restore information from random subsets of the undersampled k-space data, while a spatial-depth attention mechanism, specifically designed for three-dimensional data, enhances feature interaction and fusion. A reconstruction loss defined in k-space helps recover frequency information, and a differential loss ensures consistency between the networks.

  "title": "ClusMFL: A Cluster-Enhanced Framework for Modality-Incomplete Multimodal Federated Learning in Brain Imaging Analysis.",
  "abstract": "Multimodal Federated Learning (MFL) has emerged as a promising approach for collaboratively training multimodal models across distributed clients, particularly in healthcare domains. In the context of brain imaging analysis, modality incompleteness presents a significant challenge, where some institutions may lack specific imaging modalities (e.g., PET, MRI, or CT) due to privacy concerns, device limitations, or data availability issues. While existing work typically assumes modality completeness or oversimplifies missing-modality scenarios, we simulate a more realistic setting by considering both client-level and instance-level modality incompleteness in this study. Building on this realistic simulation, we propose ClusMFL, a novel MFL framework that leverages feature clustering for cross-institutional brain imaging analysis under modality incompleteness. Specifically, ClusMFL utilizes the FINCH algorithm to construct a pool of cluster centers for the feature embeddings of each modality-label pair, effectively capturing fine-grained data distributions. These cluster centers are then used for feature alignment within each modality through supervised contrastive learning, while also acting as proxies for missing modalities, allowing cross-modal knowledge transfer. Furthermore, ClusMFL employs a modality-aware aggregation strategy, further enhancing the model's performance in scenarios with severe modality incompleteness. We evaluate the proposed framework on the ADNI dataset, utilizing structural MRI and PET scans. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ClusMFL achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to various baseline methods across varying levels of modality incompleteness, providing a scalable solution for cross-institutional brain imaging analysis.",

  "title": "A Plug-and-Play Inertial Motion Tracking Method for Magnetometer-free Orientation Estimation of Arbitrary Joints.",
  "abstract": "Inertial motion tracking (IMT) refers to technology that uses wearable inertial sensors to track the motion of robots or humans, and it has become fundamental to various applications. To achieve a detailed, location-independent analysis of movement patterns, IMT of kinematic chains (KC) is performed. Current IMT-KC methods require expert knowledge of the joints' degrees of freedom (DoF) and their corresponding axes, limiting the applicability of IMT-KC to professional settings. This paper introduces a plug-and-play, recurrent neural network (RNN)-based model for IMT-KC. It is designed to estimate the relative orientation between adjacent inertial measurement units (IMUs) mounted on segments that are connected by rotational joints with arbitrary DoF, without requiring prior knowledge of the joint axes or DoF. The model was trained solely on simulated data, and zero-shot estimates the relative orientation of the IMUs placed on 3D-printed real-world KCs with a mean error of less than 9° for all joint types (1 DoF, 2 DoF, and 3 DoF). Although the proposed method may not always match the absolute accuracy of specialized techniques, it stands out for its flexibility, robustness, and ease of deployment. Furthermore, we show that, once it converges, the model stays highly stable and is inherently resilient to variations in IMU placement. By significantly reducing the need for detailed prior knowledge of joint configurations and offering broad adaptability across different joint types, the proposed model simplifies the deployment of inertial motion tracking systems, making them more accessible to non-experts. This represents a significant step toward applying IMT-KC in biomedical fields such as rehabilitation and everyday motion analysis outside of clinical or laboratory environments, where ease of use is crucial.",

  "title": "Attribute-Aware Adversarial Domain Augmentation for Zero-Shot Medical Domain Adaptation.",
  "abstract": "Deep learning-based medical diagnosis has demonstrated remarkable performance in in-distribution environments, whereas it remains vulnerable in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios, often producing unreliable predictions when applied to patients from unseen domains. Medical data involves diverse domains characterized by patients' attributes, such as age, which implies a high risk of encountering OOD instances. Domain generalization is a practical approach to overcome domain gaps, which does not require target data often unavailable due to strict privacy regulations for medical data. However, the lack of knowledge about a target domain limits the generalization performance of diagnosis models. To address this issue, we propose Attribute-Aware Adversarial Domain Augmentation (AAADA), a zero-shot domain adaptation approach that produces synthetic data reflecting prior knowledge of a target domain. Given target attribute information, AAADA adversarially explores instances that capture target-specific characteristics based on feature correlations among source attributes. This approach enables models to tailor their decision boundaries to the target domain effectively. Experiments on large-scale health check-up datasets demonstrate that AAADA significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy compared to state-of-the-art domain generalization methods by effectively utilizing target attribute information.",

  "abstract": "Epilepsy is a neurological disorder characterized by recurrent seizures. Effective seizure prediction can significantly improve patient safety and quality of life. Current EEG-based methods for seizure detection often rely on multichannel setups, which increase patient discomfort and computational complexity.

The model employs Common Spatial Patterns (CSP) for channel selection and Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) scalograms for feature extraction. A ResNet50-based model is trained on these scalograms to distinguish between preictal and interictal states. The proposed method achieves an average accuracy of 85.1±3.2%, sensitivity of 84.0±3.9%, and specificity of 87.4±2.8% across 13 cases, demonstrating its potential for wearable and accessible seizure detection systems.

  "title": "Gaussian Process-driven Hidden Markov Models for Early Diagnosis of Infant Gait Anomalies.",
  "abstract": "Gait analysis is critical in the early detection and intervention of motor neurological disorders in infants. Despite its importance, traditional methods often struggle to model the high variability and rapid developmental changes inherent to infant gait. To address these challenges, we propose a probabilistic Gaussian Process (GP)-driven Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to capture the complex temporal dynamics of infant gait cycles and enable automatic recognition of gait anomalies. We use a Multi-Output GP (MoGP) framework to model interdependencies between multiple gait signals, with a composite kernel designed to account for smooth, non-smooth, and periodic behaviors exhibited in gait cycles. The HMM segments gait phases into normal and abnormal states, facilitating the precise identification of pathological movement patterns in stance and swing phases. The proposed model is trained and assessed using a dataset of infants with and without motor neurological disorders via leave-one-subject-out cross-validation. Results demonstrate that the MoGP outperforms Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) based neural networks in modeling gait dynamics, offering improved accuracy, variance explanation, and temporal alignment. Further, the predictive performance of MoGP provides a principled framework for uncertainty quantification, allowing confidence estimation in gait trajectory predictions. Additionally, the HMM enhances interpretability by explicitly modeling gait phase transitions, improving the detection of subtle anomalies across multiple gait cycles. These findings highlight the MoGP-HMM framework as a robust automatic gait analysis tool showing better performance metrics compared with deep learning approaches, allowing early diagnosis and intervention strategies for infants with neurological motor disorders.",

  "title": "Comparative Study on Medical Hyperspectral Images Segmentation Using Advanced Deep Learning Techniques.",
  "abstract": "Accurate medical image segmentation is essential for disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and surgery guidance. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) improves medical imaging by providing rich spectral information, leading to improved tissue classification, cancer detection, and visualization of anatomical structures. Although deep learning-based segmentation models like U-Net and SegNet have advanced hyperspectral medical image analysis, they still face challenges in effectively handling spectral-spatial relationships. Recent advanced models, such as spectral transformers, knowledge distillation models (KDM), and dual-stream architecture, attempt to address these issues. However, there is a lack of comparative evaluation of these models on diverse medical hyperspectral datasets, making it difficult to determine the most effective approach. To address this gap, this study conducts a comprehensive evaluation of deep learning-based segmentation models, analyzing their performance across multiple medical hyperspectral datasets. Three different medical HSI datasets were collected: oral and dental, pathology, and brain datasets to evaluate three deep learning models designed to overcome specific segmentation challenges: long-distance dependency handling, and high spectral and spatial redundancy. The selected models were trained and tested on the three datasets and evaluated using the two metrics: the Intersection over Union (IoU) and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). The results indicate that KDM achieves the best performance in the pathology dataset, while as the Dual-Stream with a Feature Pyramid Network [FPN] spatial backbone performs well in the oral and dental data sets, and the Dual-Stream with a DeepLab spatial backbone excels in the brain data set. These findings provide valuable insights into model suitability for different hyperspectral medical imaging applications.Clinical relevance- This study provides valuable insights on the importance of the medical hyperspectral imaging by identifying optimal segmentation models for pathology, oral and dental, and brain imaging, improving disease diagnosis and treatment planning.",

  "title": "Sparse dictionary learning neural networks for ECG signal denoising.",
  "abstract": "Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are prone to different types of interference, which can impede evaluation and lead to false diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a novel hybrid approach for effectively removing baseline noise from ECG signals based on sparse dictionary learning (SDL). First, we use the K-singular value decomposition (K-SVD) algorithm to generate a dictionary of basis functions for typical types of ECG noise. Then, we employ a model-driven neural network based on the FISTA-Net architecture to approximate the noise in a given ECG signal as a linear combination of the dictionary atoms. Finally, the denoising is done by subtracting the reconstructed noise from the signal. Both steps of the proposed approach are learned from small datasets, while maintaining the interpretability of SDL. Our experiments using the Brno University of Technology ECG Quality Database demonstrate the superiority of this method compared to other relevant techniques, including quadratic programming and end-to-end deep learning, in both denoising performance and computational efficiency. Source code is available at https://github.com/galigergergo/ECGDenFISTA-Net.Clinical relevance-ECG is the basis for cardiovascular assessment but signal noise is a potential bias, especially in remote monitoring. False diagnosis might lead to adverse consequences for patients; therefore, noise removal is of utmost importance for patient safety.",

  "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased exceptional capabilities in understanding and generating natural language, particularly in the realm of personalized healthcare assistants. Despite these advancements, LLMs face challenges with long-term memory, limiting their effectiveness in continuous interactions and personalized recommendations. To address these limitations, we present two main contributions: (1) a novel Long-Term Health Monitoring (LTHM) dataset, which contains 30 longitudinal patient profiles with comprehensive health records, symptoms tracking, and time-stamped dialogue interactions, specifically designed for evaluating LLMs' long-term memory capabilities in healthcare scenarios, and (2) a Memory Reflection and Dynamic Retrieval Weights (RTD) mechanism to enhance LLM performance in long-term interaction scenarios. Our LTHM dataset fills a critical gap in healthcare dialogue systems by providing detailed patient-LLM conversations across various chronic conditions, enabling robust evaluation of long-term memory mechanisms. Experimental results on our LTHM dataset demonstrate that the RTD strategy achieves outstanding performance, with a correctness score of 0.786 and a coherence score of 0.764, significantly outperforming baseline approaches. The effectiveness of our approach is further validated on the MemoryBank dataset, demonstrating its applicability across different dialogue scenarios. Our dataset and the corresponding code have been released on GitHub*.",

  "title": "Quantifying Respiratory Patterns: Can Features from Wearable-Derived Respiratory Signals Reflect CAT Scores in COPD Patients?",
  "abstract": "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a progressive lung disease characterised by persistent respiratory symptoms and airflow limitation. The COPD Assessment Test (CAT) is a standardised self-reported questionnaire to quantify symptom burden. Although used widely, CAT is inherently subjective and may not fully capture day-to-day variations in symptoms. This study explores the potential of using features extracted from 24-hour-long breathing waveform derived from a chest-worn Respeck device as an objective measure of COPD severity. This measure was used to predict the daily CAT score severity levels using a machine learning-based approach. Correlation analysis revealed subject-specific relationships between respiratory features and CAT scores, with breath symmetry, respiratory rate variability, and breath duration variability emerging as significant predictors of symptom burden. Machine learning models predicted the CAT severity levels with an average accuracy of 77.89%, thus demonstrating the feasibility of this approach for monitoring COPD symptoms. This result demonstrates for the first time that respiratory features from a continuous breathing monitor can serve as objective proxies for COPD symptom burden, enabling unobtrusive and automated disease tracking. We cautiously conjecture that the proposed method will prove to be sufficiently sensitive to personalise for patients with differing COPD phenotypes, personal variations due to environmental effects, and differences due to patients being at different stages of the disease.Clinical Relevance-The results demonstrate that features extracted from the continuous respiratory signal, derived from a chest-wearable Respeck patch, can objectively assess the symptom burden of COPD patients and are correlated with the existing method of recording CAT scores. Such an approach could potentially be used for real-time, personalised symptom monitoring as part of COPD management.",

  "abstract": "Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers in men with the average age of diagnosis at 66 years. Accuracy in the early characterization of PCa is the major unmet need in disease management in order to stratify patients with indolent disease or patients with high risk for aggressive disease at an early stage. To this end, a retrospective collection of 202 histopathologically proven PCa patients was explored through quantitative diffusion MRI modelling radiomics to automatically classify Gleason score (GS) between GS<7 and GS≥7 aiming to reduce unnecessary biopsy. The classification was conducted by training a variety of classifiers with T2 and quantitative diffusion MRI data, and the explainability analysis was assessed using the Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). The best model in terms of performance was the combination of T2 and the diffusion-derived micro-perfusion fraction parametric map from the intravoxel incoherent motions (IVIM) model, exhibiting a mean accuracy of 80.91% and an AUC of 85.29%. The findings of our work suggest that tissue structural information and blood microperfusion play a significant role in predicting PCa aggressiveness.Clinical Relevance-This work establishes an automated classification of PCa aggressiveness using quantitative diffusion models accompanying T2 weighted images towards reducing the large variability across centers improving the rate of referrals for unnecessary invasive procedures such as biopsy.",

  "abstract": "Cerebral palsy (CP), one of the most common causes of physical disability in childhood, affects movement, balance and posture due to atypical brain development or damage to motor control areas. Clinical gait analysis (CGA) is essential for the diagnosis, treatment planning and management of CP, and motion capture systems are an important tool for assessing movement patterns. Markerless motion capture systems using computer vision and machine learning algorithms offer several advantages over traditional marker-based methods, including improved patient comfort, mobility and reduced set-up time. However, these systems face challenges, such as pose ambiguities in multi-person images and occlusions, which can reduce the accuracy of kinematic data in clinical applications.In this paper, we present a workflow that addresses these challenges by leveraging machine learning and computer vision techniques to improve the reliability and accuracy of markerless motion capture in clinical gait analysis (CGA). Specifically, our approach utilizes the projection of three-dimensional (3D) onto two-dimensional (2D) points to map the original 3D motion capture points onto the video plane and track the subject using distance-based metrics. Additionally, we integrate multiple data modalities to improve robustness. The proposed workflow enables detailed comparisons between markerless and marker-based systems. By improving the performance and applicability of markerless motion capture, this study contributes to a more accessible and effective clinical assessment of children with CP.",

  "abstract": "Epilepsy, a prevalent neurological disease, often requires accurate identification of the seizure onset zone (SOZ) in the brain for successful surgical removal of this region. SOZ identification is a lengthy process that traditionally relies on the knowledge and experience of the neurosurgeon. Advancements in artificial intelligence have opened the door to automatic SOZ localization. This study proposes the application of autoencoder-based anomaly detection in SOZ electrode classification for the first time. We trained the autoencoder in a leave-one-patient-out manner with electrocorticography (ECoG) signals from intact channels. The anomaly feature was determined by the maximum error between original and reconstructed signals for each channel of the test patient. We investigated the usefulness of anomaly features along with the interictal epileptiform discharge (IED) biomarker feature. A linear support vector machine classifier achieved 70.49% accuracy with the anomaly feature, 64.71% accuracy with IED feature, and 74.44% accuracy with combined anomaly and IED features. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of anomaly detection in the direct localization of SOZs and suggests that multiple biomarker features can enhance automatic SOZ localization performance.Clinical Relevance- This study demonstrates the clinical relevance of using anomaly features from ECoG data for efficient SOZ localization. It highlights the effectiveness of combining anomaly features with IED biomarkers to enhance the automatic SOZ classification performance and improve surgical planning in epilepsy treatment.",

  "title": "Site Common Information-Guided Site-to-Individual-to-Global Multi-View GCN for Psychiatric Diagnosis.",
  "abstract": "Magnetic resonance neuroimaging (MRI)-based brain functional connections show significant potential in aiding the diagnosis and assessment of psychiatric disorders. Current neuroimaging studies utilize substantial amounts of data, frequently from multiple centers, to enhance the confidence of the results. However, multi-center neuroimaging studies face challenges due to inter-site variability caused by differences in scanner configurations and acquisition protocols, leading to low data consistency with limited generality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel site common information guided Site-to-Individual-to-Global Multi-View graph convolutional network GCN (sigGCN) framework. SigGCN extracts the shared site common information to mitigate site-effects, constructs individual multi-view representations, and integrates individual and site-common features to generate global Chebyshev networks. Results show that sigGCN achieves the highest accuracy in diagnosing autism comparing with other exiting models. Moreover, sigGCN successfully classifies autism/schizophrenia from controls across 5 brain atlases with 3 independent datasets, demonstrating its robustness and stability. By systematically leveraging the hierarchical information among sites, individuals, and global networks, sigGCN offers a reliable new way to harmonize multi-center data to improve the performance of neuroimaging based psychiatric diagnosis.Clinical Relevance-The proposed sigGCN establishes a site-to-individual-to-global framework to effectively and reliably harmonize multi-center data and to improve the performance of neuroimaging based psychiatric diagnosis.",

  "title": "Optimized EEG and fMRI Biomarker Fusion Using Federated Learning for Parkinson's Disease Diagnosis.",
  "abstract": "Diagnosing Parkinson's disease (PD) is particularly challenging due to the intricate and variable nature of its biomarkers, which span motor and non-motor symptoms, differ across individuals, and evolve over time. While machine learning has been used to automate this process, most studies focus on limited biomarkers due to dataset constraints. This study introduces a Federated Learning (FL) framework that integrates electroencephalography (EEG) and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) data for improved PD classification. Unlike traditional fusion-based studies integrating multiple biomarkers from the same subject group, the Federated Learning framework processes EEG and fMRI data separately from distinct subject groups. Client nodes treat these as independent datasets and utilize convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Graph CNNs, and ResNet-18 models for analysis. A central server then aggregates insights, simulating a diagnostic center to evaluate the relevance of additional biomarkers for enhanced PD detection utilizing support vector machines (SVM) and federated dynamic model aggregation (Fed-Dyn). Additionally, gender-specific evaluations suggest that male-exclusive models outperform female models in biomarker representation. The study underscores the necessity of demographic-aware frameworks and optimized fusion techniques for early-stage PD detection.Clinical Relevance- This study significantly enhances early PD diagnosis by integrating EEG and fMRI biomarkers through Federated Learning (FL), offering a more comprehensive view of neurodegenerative changes while preserving patient privacy. By addressing gender-specific biomarker differences and tailoring models to diverse patient profiles and disease stages, it supports precision medicine and equitable healthcare. The advanced fusion techniques improve diagnostic accuracy in terms of ROC-AUC score, aiding clinical decision-making and enabling scalable telemedicine solutions. Beyond PD, the framework holds potential for broader neurodegenerative research and sets benchmarks for biomarker-based diagnostics, paving the way for impactful advancements in precision neurology.",

  "title": "Quantifying Cardiovascular Wellbeing Through ECG Age: Acquisition Constraints and the Case for Handcrafted Features.",
  "abstract": "An electrocardiogram (ECG) is a signal that captures the electrical activity generated by the cardiac muscles during contraction and relaxation. Prior research has shown that the delta between ECG-derived age and chronological age is a general indicator of cardiovascular health and mortality (i.e., cardiovascular well-being). Increased delta age is strongly associated with cardiovascular conditions, such as increased vascular aging. Despite the clinical significance of ECG-derived age, neural networks for ECG age estimation have not been extensively evaluated with respect to ECG acquisition parameters. Furthermore, recent studies have discounted the use of handcrafted features compared to the deep neural network for the ECG age estimation task. To overcome these limitations, we conduct a comprehensive study determining the influence of ECG acquisition parameters on neural network performance. We compare the performance of deep neural networks with fully connected networks trained with state-of-the-art handcrafted features to showcase the utility and significance of ECG feature engineering. Overall, we demonstrate that handcrafted features can compete with end-to-end deep neural networks for ECG age estimation while utilizing minimal computational resources and providing explainability.Clinical relevance- ECG age is a simple and intuitive surrogate metric for cardiovascular well-being that is easily understood by both patients and doctors. An elevated ECG age signals potential cardiovascular decline, enabling it to serve as a tracking tool for monitoring improvements through medications, lifestyle changes, or surgical interventions. Additionally, determining optimal acquisition parameters could guide the development of ECG-based tools better suited for various hardware platforms, including mobile devices, IoT devices, and wearables. Furthermore, the handcrafted features analysis revealed key ECG parameters that are relevant for cardiovascular well-being.",

  "abstract": "We propose a novel machine-learning method for continuous short-term seizure forecast by neonatal electroencephalogram (EEG) recorded in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). The proposed model was based on an Adaptive Boosting classifier, and supported by 22 features extracted from short-time segmented EEG. The proposed method is trained/tested on three datasets (two open datasets and one privately) recorded from 148 neonates with a diversity of gestation periods (late preterm and full-term) and diagnoses (dominantly present hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy HIE infants). The achieved performances for Matthews correlation coefficient and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve, (MCC 0.466±0.078, AUROC 0.738±0.041) respectively, outperformed the current state-of-art ML model (MCC 0.255±0.054, AUC 0.678±0.041).Clinical Relevance- The development of a ML model for predicting short-term seizures can contribute to the optimization of allocated resources for monitoring in the NICU and improve and facilitate decision-making algorithm in treatment of newborns with hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy.

  "title": "A Two-Stage Deep Learning Approach for EEG Artifact Removal and Classification: Towards Reliable Wearable Applications.",
  "abstract": "EEG artifact removal remains a critical challenge in neural signal processing. In this paper, we present a novel two-stage approach combining a modified IC-UNet architecture for artifact removal with a modified VGGNet for artifact type identification. The system automatically triggers the classification stage when the difference between original and denoised signals exceeds a learned threshold, enabling the classification of ocular artifacts (eye blinks and saccadic movements) in the original signals. The denoising stage employs parallel encoding paths with channel-specific feature extraction, followed by a shared bottleneck and decoder network. The system was evaluated using EEG data from subjects performing controlled eye blink and saccadic movement tasks. The denoising network achieves high correlation values between predicted and ground truth signals, particularly in temporal and specific frontal regions (T5: 0.86 ± 0.01, T6: 0.85 ± 0.01, F3: 0.83 ± 0.01). The classification network shows excellent performance, achieving 99.35% accuracy on the test set with only four misclassifications out of 620 cases.Clinical relevance- This study demonstrates the feasibility of accurate artifact removal and classification in temporal and behind-the-ear EEG recordings, which is particularly relevant for the development of wearable EEG devices for continuous monitoring and hybrid BCI systems.",

  "title": "SpindleX: A Multi-Scale Event Detection Window and CBAM Attention-Based Model for Sleep Spindle Detection.",
  "abstract": "Sleep spindles, characteristic waveforms in stage 2 of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep on EEG, are linked to a multitude of diseases. Although numerous sleep spindle detection methods exist, several challenges persist: 1)How to effectively utilize spindle properties, such as their duration and prominence in EEG signals? 2)How to capture spindles without threshold settings? 3)How to make spindle detection resemble object detection without converting signals into images? To address these challenges, we introduce SpindleX, a novel end-to-end sleep spindle detection algorithm. It comprises four key modules: a local feature extraction module for capturing fine-grained characteristics; a sequence feature extraction module for analyzing temporal patterns; an attention module to highlight important features across channel and spatial dimensions; and a localization and classification module to precisely pinpoint and categorize spindles. Convolutional neural networks and bidirectional long short-term memory networks are used to extract common spindle characteristics. The attention module then captures more details from the signal's channel and spatial aspects. To precisely locate spindles, multi-scale event detection windows are employed to fit the varying spindle durations, aiming to capture all spindles in the EEG sequence. Experiments on the widely-used sleep dataset MASS show that our method is significantly efficient.Clinical relevance- This study proposes a reliable automated spindle detection method, which achieves an average F1-score of 78.9% on public datasets. This method provides clinicians with an efficient and practical tool, reducing the time cost of manual scoring by experts while mitigating the inconsistency caused by subjectivity. As a result, it offers support for clinical applications such as sleep quality assessment and disease prognosis analysis.",

  "abstract": "Otitis media (OM) is a globally prevalent health issue that poses significant threats to hearing and overall health. However, traditional diagnostic methods rely heavily on subjective interpretation of otoscopic images, which often leads to inconsistent outcomes and high misdiagnosis rates. This study evaluated 5 deep learning models (ResNet-18, GoogLeNet, AlexNet, MobileNet-V3, and VGGNet-19) for classifying 819 otoscopic images into 4 categories: normal, acute otitis media, otitis media with effusion, and chronic suppurative otitis media. Specifically, the dataset was split into training (60%), validation (20%), and test (20%) sets. Subsequently, model performance was assessed using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, F1 score, and receiver operating characteristic-area under the curve analysis. The results showed that VGGNet-19 demonstrated superior performance, achieving the highest scores in accuracy (94.51%), sensitivity (94.18%), specificity (98.10%), and precision (93.86%), with particularly outstanding performance in chronic suppurative otitis media identification. While other models delivered competitive results, their metrics were consistently lower in comparison. Therefore, the study confirms VGGNet-19's potential as an accurate, automated diagnostic tool for OM classification. Future research should address dataset imbalances and validate findings across diverse clinical settings to enhance generalizability.",

  "abstract": "This study provides a bibliometric analysis of global research on anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) in corneal diseases, mapping key research trajectories, collaborations, and emerging trends. A systematic search in the Web of Science Core Collection on January 1, 2025, retrieved 3634 records (1994-2024). After excluding non-English publications, non-ophthalmology studies, and non-corneal research, 2079 publications were analyzed using VOSviewer and CiteSpace for citation networks, coauthorship trends, and keyword co-occurrence. AS-OCT research has grown significantly (Mann-Kendall τ = 0.929, P < .001). The United States led in publications (639 papers, 19,594 citations), followed by China (333 papers, 4502 citations). The University of California was the most productive institution. The first AS-OCT study, published in the Archives of Ophthalmology (1994) by Izatt JA et al, marked the field's inception. The most cited article was Huang et al's 1991 Science paper on optical coherence tomography. Recent trends highlight the integration of artificial intelligence, deep learning, and optical coherence elastography in AS-OCT applications. The top 3 contributing journals were Cornea, Journal of Refractive Surgery, and Journal of Cataract and Refractive Surgery. Coauthorship analysis identified Jodhbir S. Mehta and David Huang as central figures in AS-OCT research collaborations. AS-OCT research has expanded significantly, enhancing diagnostics, surgical planning, and disease monitoring. Artificial intelligence-driven analytics and optical coherence elastography are promising future directions. This bibliometric analysis guides advancing AS-OCT research and clinical applications.",

Concurrently, we acquired venous thromboembolism (VTE) patient data from the gene expression omnibus dataset. Utilizing cytoscape, we constructed a network connecting traditional Chinese medicine ingredients, disease targets, and related interactions. Molecular subtypes were determined through target information clustering and typing using the \"ConsensusClusterPlus\" software package. Key genes were subsequently identified through a combination of weighted gene co-expression network analysis and machine learning techniques. Functional enrichment analysis was performed on these key genes. Subsequently, we investigated immune cell and immune function differences related to the identified key genes. Lastly, we constructed the competing endogenous RNA network associated with PPP2R1A. Our initial analysis identified several key genes, including FOS, ICAM1, CASP3, and HSP90AA1. Subsequent functional and downstream analyses revealed that 2 central hub genes, PPP2R1A and ribosomal protein L9, may represent novel targets for VTE therapy. Notably, these hub genes are not only associated with thrombospondin and platelet function regulation but also play a role in modulating T cell expression in immunoassays. In conclusion, our findings suggest that 10 long non-coding RNAs may compete with 2 microRNAs for binding, thereby regulating PPP2R1A target genes, with potential implications for improving VTE treatment efficacy. Our current findings offer a novel direction and serve as a theoretical foundation for identifying therapeutic targets in the treatment of VTE. Furthermore, these findings hold the potential to facilitate the translation of our research into clinical applications in the future.",

  "abstract": "Precision medicine relies on accurate and interpretable predictive models to identify patient subgroups and biomarkers that can guide individualized treatment strategies. While extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) often achieves state-of-the-art predictive performance, its complexity can impede understanding of how input variables influence outcomes. Building upon existing XGBoost frameworks for estimating individualized treatment rule (ITR), we introduce a global permutation test within this framework to assess treatment effect heterogeneity. Additionally, we incorporate two model-agnostic explanation techniques, local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to enhance interpretability at both global and individual levels. Through simulations and analyses of real-world clinical trial datasets, we illustrate that our permutation-based pipeline can detect empirical signals of treatment effect heterogeneity, while LIME and SHAP offer exploratory insights into feature contributions and ITR.",
