  "title": "Deep Learning-Based Image Recognition for Food Science and Technology: End-to-End Workflows and Domain-Specific Solutions.",
  "abstract": "Deep learning-based image recognition is increasingly reshaping food science, enabling intelligent systems for online grading, rapid quality evaluation, and food safety monitoring. Nevertheless, the adoption of such approaches in food-related domains is often hindered by fragmented practices, limited domain-specific guidance, and methodological inconsistencies. This review synthesizes a modular end-to-end workflow, spanning task formulation, model development, and application, specifically designed for food science. Three representative case studies are examined to illustrate common applications and practices, while highlighting recurring challenges such as limited data availability, inconsistent annotations, and obstacles to submodel integration that constrain reproducibility and scalability. A set of domain-specific strategies is proposed to address these challenges, covering task decomposition, dataset refinement, annotation and label management, image preprocessing, data augmentation, architecture selection, and submodel integration. Looking ahead, we suggest that future efforts prioritize the development of standardized toolkits-task guidance systems, unified modeling toolchains, and model integration platforms-to enable reliable, generalizable, and impactful computer vision solutions for real-world challenges in food science and technology.",

  "abstract": "To identify research trends in glioma radiomics using topic modeling, to analyze development of this field and to determine areas with potential clinical and scientific significance. A comprehensive bibliometric and thematic analysis of literature data on glioma radiomics published between 2014 and 2024 was conducted. We screened the PubMed database using appropriate keywords. After preliminary screening of publications, we used topic modeling and bibliometric analysis to identify key research areas and development trends. The number of publications devoted to glioma radiomics increased between 2014 and 2024. The key research areas included segmentation and extraction of features of glioma radiographic images, validation and reproducibility of machine learning models, molecular classification of gliomas, and survival prediction. These studies highlight the importance of model reproducibility and application of radiomics together with genomic data analysis and artificial intelligence methods. Glioma radiomics demonstrates significant potential for clinical practice, particularly when integrated with molecular and genomic data. Despite rapid development of this field, there are challenges with model reproducibility and protocol standardization limiting their widespread adoption. Available studies demonstrate the need to use multiple-center data and improve interpretability of radiomics features. Future studies should focus on significant clinically applicable models and better integration of radiomics with artificial intelligence for personalized medicine. Glioma radiomics is advancing towards creation of more significant and clinically applicable models. Validation of models on diverse datasets and integration of radiomics with molecular and genomic methods are key areas of future research. Topic modeling enabled identification of key research topics reflecting current state and promising areas of radiomics application in glial tumor research.",

  "title": "Predicting high lymph node positivity risk factors in nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients: A multi-model approach.",
  "abstract": "Identifying patients at high risk of an elevated lymph node ratio (LNR) is critical for optimizing the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), as LNR, defined as the ratio of metastatic to examined lymph nodes, serves as a key prognostic indicator. This retrospective observational study aimed to investigate the epidemiology and influencing factors associated with high LNR in NPC patients. Various machine learning algorithms were employed to select independent predictive variables, and both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to develop predictive models. The performance of different models was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis, and nomograms and survival curves were constructed to facilitate visualization and clinical interpretation. A total of 1563 NPC patients were included in the study. The optimal model demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.73 (95% confidence interval: 0.67-0.78) in the modeling group and 0.76 (95% confidence interval: 0.70-0.81) in the validation group. The nomogram identified N stage, M stage, type of surgery, race, and confirmation status as independent risk factors for high LNR. Survival curve analysis further indicated that patients classified as high-risk by the nomogram had significantly worse outcomes. These findings suggest that elevated LNR is strongly associated with adverse prognosis in NPC patients. The constructed nomogram serves as a practical clinical tool to stratify patients based on LNR risk, thereby enabling personalized follow-up, treatment planning, and management strategies to optimize patient outcomes.",

  "title": "Personalized prediction of post-SMILE refractive outcomes using a machine-learning nomogram.",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to construct a personalized, machine learning-driven nomogram capable of predicting refractive outcomes following small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE). A total of 1253 eyes from 632 patients who underwent SMILE to correct myopia or myopic astigmatism were retrospectively reviewed. Comprehensive preoperative and postoperative parameters were collected. Feature selection was performed using both clinical expertise and statistical approaches. Four machine-learning models - linear regression, decision tree, random forest, and neural network - were trained to estimate postoperative manifest refraction spherical equivalent (MRSE). The nomogram was established based on the best-performing model and subsequently evaluated using an external independent cohort. Among the tested algorithms, the random forest model demonstrated the highest predictive performance, achieving a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.18 D, root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.24 D, and an R2 of 0.92 in the validation dataset. The final individualized nomogram incorporated 11 key predictors and maintained strong predictive ability when applied to the external validation set. The overall postoperative MRSE averaged -0.08 ± 0.32 D, with 92.3% and 99.4% of treated eyes falling within ±0.50 D and ±1.00 D of intended correction, respectively. The machine learning-derived personalized nomogram provides a highly accurate and transferable tool for forecasting SMILE refractive outcomes. Its implementation may contribute to improved precision and predictability in clinical refractive surgery planning.",

  "title": "Association between systemic inflammation response index and coronary heart disease risk based on NHANES data: A cross-sectional study of trend analysis and epidemiological evidence.",
  "abstract": "Systemic inflammation is increasingly recognized as a critical factor in the development of coronary heart disease (CHD). The systemic inflammation response index (SIRI) integrates the neutrophil, lymphocyte, and monocyte counts to provide a comprehensive inflammatory marker. However, the relationship between the SIRI and CHD risk remains unclear. This study aimed to investigate the association between SIRI and CHD risk in adults using data from the 2012 to 2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2012-2018. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis was conducted to explore potential nonlinear relationships, and subgroup analyses were used to evaluate the demographic and clinical modifiers. Logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the association between SIRI and CHD risk after adjusting for demographic, behavioral, and clinical covariates. RCS analysis examined nonlinear trends and subgroup analyses stratified the results by age and sex. Of the 8612 participants initially screened, 1121 were included in the final analysis. Elevated SIRI levels were significantly associated with higher CHD risk (odds ratio [OR] = 1.14, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05-1.25, P < .001). RCS analysis showed a linear relationship between the SIRI and CHD risk (P for nonlinearity = .056). Subgroup analysis demonstrated stronger associations in males (OR = 1.21, 95% CI: 1.10-1.34) and individuals aged ≥55 years (OR = 1.18, 95% CI: 1.08-1.29), whereas no significant associations were found in female or younger populations. This study underscores the utility of the SIRI as a potential biomarker for CHD risk. The linear association between the SIRI and CHD risk emphasizes the importance of systemic inflammation, particularly in males and older adults. Further studies should investigate targeted anti-inflammatory interventions to potentially reduce CHD risk. However, due to the cross-sectional design of this study, it is important to note that no temporal or causal relationship can be inferred between SIRI levels and CHD risk intention-to-treat.",

  "title": "Exploring the pathogenesis of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease complicated by atherosclerosis via bioinformatics.",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to explore the common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between atherosclerosis (AS) and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) through bioinformatics. The GSE89632 and GSE100927 datasets from the open-source GEO database were selected for analysis in this study. DEGs between the control and disease groups were identified from the datasets of NAFLD and AS, leading to the identification of genes that are commonly dysregulated in both conditions. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed on 2 datasets, followed by Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses to investigate the potential biological functions and signaling pathways associated with the common DEGs. A protein-protein interaction network was constructed using the STRING database to identify hub genes. The diagnostic efficacy of these hub genes was evaluated through receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of the GSE63067 and GSE57691 datasets. A total of 45 common DEGs were identified. GSEA indicated that there were common pathways in the GSE89632 and GSE100927 datasets. The GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses revealed that the co-expressed genes were mainly enriched in regulating cytokine production, increasing responsiveness to external stimuli, and macrophage activation. The identified signaling pathways primarily included cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, the toll-like receptor signaling pathway, and the interleukin-17 signaling pathway. Ten hub genes were OSM, IL1B, CCL3, CSF3, IL1RN, TAGLN, CNN1, RGCC, MYH11, and ACTG2. Common DEGs were identified between AS and NAFLD, indicating that these diseases may mutually influence and exacerbate each other during their progression. Exploring their shared pathogenic mechanisms may provide insights into potential therapeutic targets and contribute to the prevention of AS development in patients with NAFLD.",

  "title": "Precision identification of endometrial malignancy and precancerous lesions: Development of a machine learning model incorporating multidimensional clinical and imaging parameters.",
  "abstract": "To develop and validate a machine learning (ML) model integrating multidimensional clinical, pathomic, and ultrasound radiomic parameters for precise identification of endometrial malignancy and precancerous lesions, with a focus on addressing the diagnostic needs of younger patients pursuing fertility preservation. This retrospective study enrolled patients with suspected endometrial lesions from a single institution. Clinical baseline data (e.g., age, body mass index, menopausal status), pathomic features (e.g., cellular atypia, gland density), and ultrasound radiomic parameters (e.g., endometrial thickness, resistance index) were collected. Key predictors were selected using Pearson correlation, SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. Seven ML models were constructed and optimized via 5-fold cross-validation. Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as ROC-AUC, sensitivity, specificity, and precision-recall performance in training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. A total of 1221 patients (854 in training, 367 in testing) were included. Seven variables including age, body mass index, menopausal status, cellular atypia, gland density, endometrial thickness, and resistance index emerged as robust predictors. Among the 7 ML models, the random forest model showed superior performance, with receiver operating characteristic area under curve of 0.98 in the training set and 0.96 in the testing set (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.93-0.98). It had balanced sensitivity (0.89, 95% CI: 0.75-0.96) and specificity (0.86, 95% CI: 0.82-0.90) in the testing set. It maintained stability across varying risk thresholds and cost-benefit ratios, outperforming other models in precision-recall balance. Integration of multidimensional data via ML, particularly the random forest model, enhances the precision of endometrial malignancy detection. This approach enables personalized risk stratification, supporting targeted management for younger patients and advancing patient-centered care.",

  "abstract": "The cochlear implant (CI) is a successful biomedical device that enables individuals with severe-to-profound hearing loss to perceive sound through electrical stimulation, yet listening in noise remains challenging. Recent deep learning advances offer promising potential for CI sound coding by integrating visual cues. In this study, an audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) module is integrated with the ElectrodeNet-CS (ECS) model to form the end-to-end CI system, AVSE-ECS. Simulations show that the AVSE-ECS system with joint training achieves high objective speech intelligibility and improves the signal-to-error ratio by 7.4666 dB compared to the advanced combination encoder strategy. These findings underscore the potential of AVSE-based CI sound coding.",

  "abstract": "Data retrieval underpins the success of clinical audits, quality improvement initiatives, and research. Over recent decades, healthcare systems have transitioned from manual chart review to electronic patient record (EPR) systems, informatics-driven queries, and now artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted methods. Each stage has brought improvements in scale and efficiency but has also introduced new challenges in accuracy, coding reliability, and access to clinically meaningful detail. This review traces the evolution of data sourcing methods, from manual extraction to digital workflows, examines the balance between structured and unstructured data, and highlights the emerging role of prompt engineering and natural language processing (NLP). By combining insights from literature and clinical practice, it outlines the limitations of current systems and the opportunities that future innovations may provide.",

  "title": "A machine learning and explainable AI framework for adsorption energy prediction via effective representation of the adsorbate chemical environment.",
  "abstract": "Adsorption energies, which capture the interactions between adsorbates and solid surfaces, are central to heterogeneous catalysis. Machine learning (ML) offers a powerful approach for rapidly and accurately predicting adsorption energies from computational data, thereby accelerating catalyst screening. The effectiveness of ML models depends on accurately representing the chemical environments of atoms, incorporating both geometric and electronic properties that influence adsorbate-surface interactions. In this study, we present an ML framework that leverages advanced electronic structure descriptors via Gaussian Multipole (GMP) featurization. GMP approximates electron density using Gaussian basis functions, providing a novel representation of elemental identity. Combined with robust geometric features, our model predicts CO and H binding energies (ΔECO∗ and ΔEH∗) on multimetallic alloys, achieving mean absolute errors of 0.07 eV for ΔECO∗ and 0.06 eV for ΔEH∗. To interpret the model's predictions, we applied Shapley additive explanations, a post hoc explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) method. The analysis revealed that GMP features associated with adsorbates and their first-nearest neighbors (FNNs) played the most significant role in determining binding energies, while features from second-nearest neighbors had minimal influence. In addition, broader elemental properties such as boiling point, group number, and atomic number were found to be more predictive of adsorption behavior than conventional features, such as electronegativity. Clustering and t-SNE analyses showed that similar FNN environments yield consistent binding energies, supporting the model's ability to generalize. Overall, this work demonstrates that integrating electronic structure features with explainable AI improves both predictive accuracy and interpretability, offering a powerful strategy for accelerated catalyst screening and rational catalyst design.",

  "title": "Image enhancement for accelerated MRI using a joint GAN and diffusion model framework.",
  "abstract": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a defining feature of magnetic resonance image-guided radiotherapy (MRigRT), providing superior soft-tissue contrast compared to conventional cone beam CT (CBCT). However, conventional MRI protocols typically require prolonged acquisition times. High-speed scanning techniques implemented to improve clinical workflow efficiency often produce low-quality images, characterized by reduced resolution and blurring, which compromise the accuracy of downstream tasks. Although deep learning-based enhancement methods have shown promise, most fail to adequately correct residual errors between predicted and actual images, introducing uncertainties in clinical decisions. This study aims to propose and evaluate a deep learning-based approach to enhance the image quality of accelerated MRI acquisitions, with the dual objectives of ensuring registration accuracy for precise tumor targeting, and shortening in-room time to minimize patient discomfort on the treatment couch. We acquired 72 paired 3D T2-weighted MRI scans from 62 glioma patients using a 1.5T Unity MR-Linac, with each pair comprising a standard protocol scan and an accelerated protocol scan. We proposed Residual Refinement Enhancement Network (RRENet), a novel end-to-end deep learning framework that combines generative adversarial network (GAN) and diffusion model (DM) for accelerated MRI enhancement. The framework operates in a two-stage process: first, a GAN-based predictor generates the low-frequency content; subsequently, a DM-based module refines the output by estimating residual errors. To further improve performance, an additional High-frequency Separation Training Module (HSTM) was incorporated to preserve fine anatomical details. Image quality was assessed using peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and root mean square error (RMSE). Clinical applicability was evaluated through rigid registration analysis with commercial software. RRENet demonstrated superior performance compared to competing methods, achieving a 70% reduction in imaging time (vs. standard protocol) while maintaining high quality (SSIM = 92.27 2.03%, PSNR = 32.84 1.54dB, RMSE = 0.025). Enhanced images retained fine anatomical structures alignment ( 2.2 mm translation, 0.2 rotation) to planning CT, ensuring the accuracy of patient setup correction. The proposed method can generate high-quality images from high-speed scanning sequences, reducing acquisition time while ensuring precise tumor targeting through reliable image registration.",

  "abstract": "Warfarin, a classic oral anticoagulant, is characterized by a narrow therapeutic window and considerable interindividual variability in dosing requirements. This makes precise dose adjustment challenging in clinical practice and increases the risk of bleeding or thrombosis. To improve dose prediction, this study developed a streamlined multilayer perceptron (MLP) model using real-world data from the International Warfarin Pharmacogenomics Consortium (IWPC) database. The LASSO-proj algorithm was applied for high-precision feature selection prior to model construction. The resulting model demonstrated strong predictive performance on the test set, achieving a coefficient of determination ( ) of 0.456, a mean absolute error (MAE) of 8.92 mg/week, and 48.522% of its predictions falling within ±20% of the actual stable therapeutic dose. Through SHAP-based interpretation using DeepExplainer, key features influencing warfarin dosing were identified, including the genotype, body weight, age, and ethnicity. The interpretable MLP framework incorporating LASSO-proj not only maintains high predictive accuracy, but also significantly enhances model transparency, providing a valuable tool for guiding warfarin therapy.",

  "abstract": "Three-dimensional (3D) deformable image registration plays a critical role in 3D medical image processing. This technique aligns images from different time points, modalities, or individuals in 3D space, enabling the comparison and fusion of anatomical or functional information. To simultaneously capture the local details of anatomical structures and the long-range dependencies in 3D medical images, while reducing the high costs of manual annotations, this paper proposes an unsupervised 3D medical image registration method based on shifted window Transformer and convolutional neural network (CNN), termed Swin Transformer-CNN-hybrid network (STCHnet). In the encoder part, STCHnet uses Swin Transformer and CNN to extract global and local features from 3D images, respectively, and optimizes feature representation through feature fusion. In the decoder part, STCHnet utilizes Swin Transformer to integrate information globally, and CNN to refine local details, reducing the complexity of the deformation field while maintaining registration accuracy. Experiments on the information extraction from images (IXI) and open access series of imaging studies (OASIS) datasets, along with qualitative and quantitative comparisons with existing registration methods, demonstrate that the proposed STCHnet outperforms baseline methods in terms of Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and standard deviation of the log-Jacobian determinant (SDlogJ), achieving improved 3D medical image registration performance under unsupervised conditions.",

  "abstract": "This study proposes an automated neurofibroma detection method for whole-body magnetic resonance imaging (WBMRI) based on radiomics and ensemble learning. A dynamic weighted box fusion mechanism integrating two dimensional (2D) object detection and three dimensional (3D) segmentation is developed, where the fusion weights are dynamically adjusted according to the respective performance of the models in different tasks. The 3D segmentation model leverages spatial structural information to effectively compensate for the limited boundary perception capability of 2D methods. In addition, a radiomics-based false positive reduction strategy is introduced to improve the robustness of the detection system. The proposed method is evaluated on 158 clinical WBMRI cases with a total of 1,380 annotated tumor samples, using five-fold cross-validation. Experimental results show that, compared with the best-performing single model, the proposed approach achieves notable improvements in average precision, sensitivity, and overall performance metrics, while reducing the average number of false positives by 17.68. These findings demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high detection accuracy with enhanced false positive suppression and strong generalization potential.",

  "abstract": "Osteoarthritis is a common degenerative joint disease, which is often analyzed by X-ray images. However, if there is a lack of clinical experience when reading the films, it is easy to cause misdiagnosis. Although deep learning has made significant progress in the field of medical image processing, existing models still have limitations in capturing subtle lesion features such as joint spaces. This paper proposes an automatic diagnosis method for osteoarthritis based on the improved shifted windows Transformer (Swin Transformer) and graph convolutional network. By enhancing the modeling of joint space features and cross-layer feature fusion, it is expected to effectively improve the accuracy of early diagnosis of osteoarthritis. Firstly, this paper designs the shifted windows horizontal attention mechanism (SW-HAM), which can enhance the feature extraction ability in the horizontal direction. Secondly, the central-attention graphSAGE (CAG-SAGE) is introduced to conduct weighted aggregation of the feature information of the lesion area through the dynamic attention mechanism. Finally, cross-layer connection technology is utilized to achieve efficient fusion of multi-layer features. The experimental results show that the SW-HAM and CAG-SAGE modules and cross-layer connections significantly improve the model performance. The classification accuracy, recall rate, precision rate, F1 score, and area under the curve are 94.59%, 95.14%, 94.05%, 94.41%, and 96.30% respectively, all of which are superior to the classical network and existing methods. It provides a new and effective method for the classification and diagnosis of osteoarthritis.",

  "abstract": "Diabetic retinopathy (DR) and its complication, diabetic macular edema (DME), are major causes of visual impairment and even blindness. The occurrence of DR and DME is pathologically interconnected, and their clinical diagnoses are closely related. Joint learning can help improve the accuracy of diagnosis. This paper proposed a novel adaptive lesion-aware fusion network (ALFNet) to facilitate the joint grading of DR and DME. ALFNet employed DenseNet-121 as the backbone and incorporated an adaptive lesion attention module (ALAM) to capture the distinct lesion characteristics of DR and DME. A deep feature fusion module (DFFM) with a shared-parameter local attention mechanism was designed to learn the correlation between the two diseases. Furthermore, a four-branch composite loss function was introduced to enhance the network's multi-task learning capability. Experimental results demonstrated that ALFNet achieved superior joint grading performance on the Messidor dataset, with joint accuracy rates of 0.868 (DR 2 & DME 3), outperforming state-of-the-art methods. These results highlight the unique advantages of the proposed approach in the joint grading of DR and DME, thereby improving the efficiency and accuracy of clinical decision-making.",

  "title": "[A coronary artery plaque segmentation method based on focal weighted accuracy loss function].",
  "abstract": "Medical images of coronary artery plaque are always accompanied by the situation of extreme class imbalance. The traditional two-step methods locate the region of interest (ROI) in the sample firstly, and then segment the sample within the ROI. On the other hand, the traditional resampling methods use resampling strategies to increase the number of minority class samples to mitigate the effects of class imbalance. These two types of methods either make the network structure more complex or decrease training efficiency and performance of the model due to the increase of samples. This paper proposes a method including a novel focal weighted accuracy loss function and improved metrics evaluation algorithms to address the issues in the segmentation of coronary artery calcification plaque mentioned above. Experimental results on the selected dataset show the proposed method increased the training speed and improved the segmentation performance of the model without performing resampling on the dataset. Specifically, the F1-score was 0.873 5, the precision was 0.929 6, and the recall was 0.823 8. The F1-score was largely improved compared with the method using focal loss function. Furthermore, compared with methods with multiple models and methods via resampling the minority class samples, research results demonstrate that the proposed method improved the accuracy and efficiency in coronary artery plaque segmentation while has a shorter training time, which lays the foundation for improving the efficiency and scientific nature of diagnosing related diseases in the future.",

  "abstract": "Automated detection of myocardial infarction (MI) is crucial for preventing sudden cardiac death and enabling early intervention in cardiovascular diseases. This paper proposes a deep learning framework based on a lightweight convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with one-dimensional gradient-weighted class activation mapping (1D Grad-CAM) for the automated detection of MI and the visualization of key waveform features in single-lead electrocardiograms (ECGs). The proposed method was evaluated using a total of 432 records from the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt Diagnostic ECG Database (PTBDB) and the Normal Sinus Rhythm Database (NSRDB), comprising 334 MI and 98 normal ECGs. Experimental results demonstrated that the model achieved an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 95.75%, 96.03%, and 95.47%, respectively, in MI detection. Furthermore, the visualization results indicated that the model's decision-making process aligned closely with clinically critical features, including pathological Q waves, ST-segment elevation, and T-wave inversion. This study confirms that the proposed deep learning algorithm combined with explainable technology performs effectively in the intelligent diagnosis of MI and the visualization of critical ECG waveforms, demonstrating its potential as a useful tool for early MI risk assessment and computer-aided diagnosis.",

  "abstract": "Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are a major cause of clinical trial failure and postmarket withdrawal, posing significant risks to public health and impeding drug development. While computational methods offer an alternative to costly preclinical testing, existing models often fail with novel compounds by requiring pre-existing information such as drug-ADR associations or by inadequately integrating diverse data sources. Here, we introduce DeepADR, a multimodal deep learning framework for predicting both the occurrence and frequency of ADRs using early-stage, readily available data. DeepADR integrates chemical structures and biological target profiles with semantic representations of ADR terms derived from a large language model (LLMs). These heterogeneous parameters are fused using a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN), which enhances the modeling of complex, nonlinear relationships among modalities to improve predictive performance. Our model outperforms existing methods in predicting both ADR occurrence and frequency, demonstrating robust generalization to new chemical entities. DeepADR showed consistently better performance than other models across both classification and regression tasks. By effectively integrating chemical, biological, and semantic datasets, DeepADR provides a powerful, scalable tool for the early-stage safety assessment and candidate prioritization. This framework not only facilitates the prioritization of safer drug candidates but also offers a methodology for predicting the toxicity of other hazardous materials, holding significant promise for advancing public health.",

  "abstract": "Intradialytic hypotension (IDH) is a prevalent and critical complication of haemodialysis associated with significant morbidity, mortality, and reduced quality of life in end-stage renal disease patients. IDH results from multifactorial interactions, including excessive ultrafiltration rates (UFR), rapid osmotic shifts, impaired vascular resistance, and comorbidities such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. It triggers hypovolemic stress, leading to myocardial stunning, cerebral ischemia, and organ dysfunction. Non-modifiable risk factors, including age and preexisting conditions, exacerbate susceptibility, while modifiable elements such as high interdialytic weight gain and improper dialysis prescriptions worsen outcomes. In this review, we aim to conduct an in-depth analysis of IDH, exploring its clinical relevance, underlying mechanisms, risk factors, and management approaches. Additionally, we advocate for a standardised definition and propose a strategic framework to guide future research efforts. Effective management requires individualised approaches, including optimised UFR, cooled dialysate, and nutritional adjustments, alongside emerging technologies like bio-impedance spectroscopy and artificial intelligence for real-time risk prediction. A multidisciplinary team approach, incorporating nephrologists, nurses, and dietitians, is essential for holistic patient care. Future research and technological advancements hold promise for mitigating IDH's clinical and systemic impact, ultimately improving patient outcomes and survival.",

  "abstract": "The role of artificial intelligence is growing in healthcare and disease prediction. Because of its potential impact and demographic disparities that have been identified in machine learning models for disease prediction, there are growing concerns about transparency, accountability and fairness of these predictive models. However, very little research has investigated methods for improving model fairness in disease prediction, particularly when the sensitive attribute is multivariate and when the distribution of sensitive attribute groups is highly skewed. In this work, we explore algorithmic fairness when predicting heart disease and Alzheimer's Disease and Related Dementias (ADRD). We propose a fine tuning approach to improve model fairness that takes advantage of observations from the majority groups to build a pre-trained model and uses observations from each underrepresented subgroup to fine tune the pre-trained model, thereby incorporating additional specific knowledge about each subgroup. We find that our fine tuning approach performs better than other algorithmic fairness fixing methods across all subgroups even if the subgroup distribution is very imbalanced and some subgroups are very small. This is an important step toward understanding approaches for improving fairness for healthcare and disease prediction.",

  "abstract": "As the driving force of the bioeconomy, biomanufacturing is facilitating the transition of current production feedstocks and methods toward green and sustainable alternatives. Bioproducts are expected to span multiple sectors including energy, chemicals, materials, food, pharmaceuticals, and agriculture, exemplified by biofuels such as lignocellulosic ethanol and sustainable aviation fuel (SAF), biodegradable materials such as polylactic acid (PLA) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA), as well as other high-value bioproducts such as microbial proteins, functional sugars, collagens, and bio-based dyes. This review explores the future directions of biomanufacturing in three aspects: sustainable feedstocks, robust microbial strains, and automatic production processes. Specifically, it includes the shift of feedstocks from grain crops towards low-carbon resources such as non-grain biomass and CO, the rational design and efficient construction of industrial strains through advanced genome editing, automated platforms, and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, and the precise regulation and optimization of production processes combining Raman spectroscopy, automated equipment, and intelligent control. By enhancing multi-technology integration, improving the industrial chain, and deepening international cooperation, the challenges faced by current biomanufacturing in technology innovation, feedstock supply, and policy systems can be overcome. This will enable biomanufacturing to capture a significant share of the global manufacturing industry and become a pivotal force in leading the high-quality development of the bioeconomy. This review aims to draw attentions to biomanufacturing technology and deepen our understanding of the bioeconomy for promoting biomanufacturing industry in China.",

  "abstract": "Synthetic biology and biomanufacturing, two cutting-edge directions in biotechnology, are rapidly developing and regarded as the core driving force of the \"third biotechnology revolution\". They reshape the paradigm of industrial manufacturing through designing life and making useful products and promote the industrial revolution in healthcare, energy, agriculture, and environmental protection. However, the development of synthetic biology and biomanufacturing, especially in terms of designing life for practical applications, still faces challenges such as insufficient screening capabilities, culture heterogeneity, and limited regulation and control over biological processes. Microfluidics, with its micro-scale fluid manipulation capability, offers new solutions to these challenges through single-cell precision, high-throughput screening, and rapid iteration. This study reviews microfluidics regarding the applications in the design-build-test-learn (DBTL) cycle of synthetic biology and the role in intensifying biomanufacturing processes, including upstream stain and culture improvement and downstream processing integration and optimization. Then, some case studies of microfluidics-driven synthetic biology and biomanufacturing in the fields of chemicals & materials, agrifood, and healthcare were summarized. Finally, the bottlenecks of microfluidics in synthetic biology and biomanufacturing, such as micro-scale amplification and chip materials, were analyzed, and the future directions, including its role as an enabling technology, interdisciplinary integration, and AI-driven intelligent systems, were discussed. This review is expected to serve as a valuable reference for further innovation in synthetic biology and biomanufacturing.",

  "abstract": "5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA) is an important non-proteinogenic amino acid that is widely used in biomedicine, agriculture, and the food industry. In recent years, with the development of synthetic biotechnology, building microbial cell factories for efficient production of 5-ALA has become a research hotspot. This article reviews the latest advances in producing 5-ALA synthetic biotechnology strategies, including metabolic pathway optimization, key enzyme engineering, and fermentation process optimization. By reconstructing natural C4 and C5 pathways and developing non-natural synthetic routes, precise regulation of the precursor metabolic flux for 5-ALA has been achieved. In addition, the directed evolution and rational design of key enzymes such as 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS), glutamyl tRNA reductase (HemA), and glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase (HemL) significantly improved catalytic efficiency. Regarding chassis cells, microorganisms such as and have been widely used to construct efficient production platforms. The precise regulation of metabolic pathways enables effective balancing of metabolic burden and toxicity, thereby increasing the 5-ALA yield. Although significant progress has been made in the biosynthesis research and large-scale production of 5-ALA, the weak lipophilicity, low stability, and poor bioavailability of 5-ALA have reduced its application efficiency. How to improve its stability and lipophilicity is a key issue to be addressed in the future. Integrating artificial intelligence-assisted design with synthetic biology-driven optimization and novel chassis development is expected to further advance green and efficient industrial-scale production of 5-ALA. By comprehensively outlining synthetic biology strategies to boost 5-ALA yield and identifying key market challenges, this review provides a roadmap for industrial-scale production via multidisciplinary integration, thereby informing and guiding future research and industrial efforts in this field.",

  "abstract": "The global rise in the older adults highlights an urgent need for nutritional strategies capable of mitigating age-related declines in protein digestion and absorption. Simply increasing dietary protein intake is insufficient without improving protein bioavailability of protein in the elderly gastrointestinal tract is not addressed. This review critically evaluates the field and identifies several key findings to guide future studies and product development. First, protein sources and food matrices must be aligned with age-related physiological changes, including reduced digestive enzyme activity, diminished gastrointestinal motility, and alterations in gut microbiota composition. Liquid and semi-solid foods are more suitable for older adults with chewing or swallowing difficulties, and animal proteins generally exhibit higher digestibility than plant proteins in them. Second, emerging food-processing technologies, such as 3D printing, drying, extrusion, and homogenization, show substantial potential for improving protein bioavailability, particularly when combined with personalized formulation strategies. Third, elderly in vitro digestion models currently represent the practically valuable tools for evaluating protein bioaccessibility. Finally, successful translation into practice will require overcoming several key challenges, including the development of high-quality geriatric-specific datasets to support artificial intelligence (AI)-based predictive tools and the establishment of unified bioavailability assessment criteria and labeling frameworks. Collectively, these insights provide a conceptual roadmap to guide the development of scientifically grounded, personalized protein products for older adults.",

  "abstract": "The integration of intelligent sensing, artificial intelligence (AI), and control technologies is reshaping traditional winemaking into a more data-driven and responsive process. This review proposes the concept of an Intelligent Oenological System (IOS) and critically reviews recent developments in smart winemaking technologies, with a focus on technologies involving Internet of Things (IoT) devices, sensor networks, and AI-based modeling. Key innovations include the deployment of multimodal sensors for real-time monitoring of temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, spectral signals, and gas evolution across stages from grape maceration to wine aging. Advances in machine learning and digital twin models support predictive control of fermentation, whereas reinforcement learning and inverse design frameworks enable data-informed decision-making toward specific flavor targets. These technologies contribute to improved process precision, reduced resource consumption, and greater product consistency. Nevertheless, challenges, such as data interoperability, model interpretability, and system integration, continue to limit widespread adoption. Emerging solutions involving edge computing and standardized data ontologies are helping to address these issues. By aligning intelligent winemaking with sustainability, traceability, and personalized flavor goals, this review highlights its transformative potential for the future of the wine industry.",

  "title": "Artificial Intelligence Reshaping Non-Starch Polysaccharides Research: A Comprehensive Review of Intelligent Integration From Extraction Optimization to Functional Design.",
  "abstract": "Over the past few decades, significant progress has been made in the research of polysaccharides extracted from natural resources, which are often used in functional foods, medicines, cosmetics, and biomedical materials. However, traditional research heavily relies on trial-and-error screening, which is limited by challenges in elucidating structure-function relationships, low preparation efficiency, and poor application adaptability. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) has provided a critical pathway to overcome these constraints. This review outlines recent AI applications in polysaccharide research, discusses current challenges, and identifies future trends. For polysaccharide extraction, AI employs models such as artificial neural networks and genetic algorithm-backpropagation to optimize processing conditions. Its prediction accuracy often reaches above 0.95, significantly higher than the 0.7-0.8 of traditional response surface methodology models. In practical applications, AI integrates multi-omics data to support personalized polysaccharide scheme design. For instance, graph convolutional networks can correlate structural features with biological activities (e.g., tumor cell inhibition rates and immune cell activation), thereby promoting the development of personalized functional products. However, the field still faces challenges such as inconsistent data quality, limited model interpretability, and difficulties in cross-disciplinary collaboration. Solving these problems is key to advancing AI from a supportive tool to a central driver of innovation in polysaccharide research, with potential impacts on precision medicine, functional foods, and advanced biomaterials.",

  "abstract": "Reliable early detection of Alzheimer's disease (AD) remains difficult due to heterogeneous progression trajectories and variability in clinical presentation. Multimodal approaches leveraging neuroimaging and clinical data offer promise but often struggle with effective integration and generalization. We developed Alzheimer's Disease Language and Image Pre-Training (ADLIP), a vision-language framework that integrates 3D T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging with structured clinical records. The model uses a multi-teacher training strategy to enhance generalizability and robustness across modalities, enabling more reliable representation learning for AD diagnosis. ADLIP outperformed baseline CLIP and fine-tuned CLIP models in three-class classification and zero-shot diagnosis, achieving improved accuracy, F score, and macro-area under the curve. Longitudinal evaluation demonstrated alignment with clinical trajectories. ADLIP maintained performance across racial subgroups without retraining. Our results demonstrate that contrastive multimodal representation learning enables clinically meaningful, generalizable, and temporally stable AD diagnosis across diverse populations. A novel vision-language foundation model (Alzheimer's Disease Language and Image Pre-Training [ADLIP]) integrates 3D magnetic resonance imaging and clinical text for Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. ADLIP enables zero-shot prediction of unseen data and cognitive scores without task-specific fine-tuning. The model demonstrates strong generalizability across racially diverse cohorts, supporting equitable clinical use. Longitudinal evaluation shows alignment with disease progression, highlighting utility for monitoring applications.",

  "abstract": "Machine learning (ML)-driven quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) modeling has gained significant attention for predicting compound biological activity based on compounds' structural, chemical, and physical properties because of the advancement of ML techniques. However, traditional ML-QSAR models often suffer from biases due to algorithm selection and limitations in training data. Additionally, these approaches root in deducing biological activities purely from compounds' structural information and disregard their pharmacokinetic (PK) properties, a key factor contributing to the 15% failure rate in clinical trials, limiting their applicability in drug discovery. To address these challenges, we propose a guided ensemble-based ML approach that integrates a supervised data preparation strategy with an ensemble stacking method, leveraging the strengths of multiple ML algorithms. By incorporating PK properties, our approach enhances prediction reliability. Specifically, we developed two ensemble stacking models: The classification model predicts the biological activity type, \"inhibition\" versus \"activation,\" based on compound features, while the regression model predicts bioactivity values. The classification model achieved an accuracy exceeding 0.85, while the regression model attained an R above 0.77, demonstrating superior performance over traditional QSAR models. These results highlight the potential of our approach in improving drug discovery pipelines by enhancing predictive accuracy and addressing key QSAR limitations.",

  "title": "Deciphering RNA modification and post-transcriptional regulation with NetRNApan.",
  "abstract": "RNA modification, which is evolutionarily conserved, is crucial for modulating various biological functions and disease pathogenesis. High resolution transcriptome-wide mapping of RNA modifications has facilitated both data resources and computational prediction of RNA modification. While these prediction algorithms are promising, they are limited in interpretability or generalizability, or the capacity for discovering novel post-transcriptional regulations. Here, we present NetRNApan, a deep learning framework for RNA modification site prediction, motif discovery and trans-regulatory factor identification. Using m5U profiles generated by FICC-seq and miCLIP-seq technologies and single-base resolution m6A sites from multiple experiments as cases, we demonstrated the accuracy of NetRNApan with more efficient and interpretive feature representations. For m5U modification, we uncovered five representative clusters with consensus motifs that may be essential by decoding the informative characteristics detected by NetRNApan. Furthermore, NetRNApan revealed interesting trans-regulatory factors and provided a protein-binding perspective for investigating the function of RNA modifications. Specifically, we discovered 21 potential functional RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) whose binding sites were significantly linked to the extracted top-scoring motifs for m5U modification. Two examples are ANKHD1 and RBM4 with potential regulatory function of m5U modifications. Meanwhile, the analysis of convolution layer parameters within the model offers valuable insights into the regulation of m6A in humans.

  "title": "Cerebellar Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation Accelerates Motor Adaptation via the Modulation of Cortical Synchrony.",
  "abstract": "Motor adaptation is a form of motor learning that enables the updating of motor commands in response to sensory inputs, requiring computations at the cerebellar level that must be integrated into cerebral cortical networks for their implementation. We proposed that cerebellar-cortical integration, which underlies motor adaptation, is related to the modulation of frequency-specific oscillatory activity. We examined motor error and electrophysiological correlates (power spectrum and phase locking value analysis) measured during different sessions of transcranial alternating stimulation (tACS) delivered to the cerebellum at relevant frequencies (50 Hz, 20 Hz, or sham). We found that 50 Hz tACS, but not 20 Hz or sham stimulation, reduced movement error, especially in initial practice trials. Electroencephalography (EEG) analysis revealed modulation of spectral power and phase synchrony (wPLI) in frontal, parietal, and occipital regions, with specific patterns for both the frequency range and the task stage. Power and wPLI modulation under fifty Hz stimulation were associated with the magnitude of motor adaptation. Our findings suggest that frequency-specific neural oscillations play a crucial role in the effective integration between the cerebellum and cortical regions of the brain. Significance: Our data indicate that cerebellar tACS at approximately 50 Hz may serve as an effective neuromodulation strategy to enhance motor adaptation in humans, with specific neural correlates.",

  "title": "Choice of species affects phylogenetic stability of deep nodes: an empirical example in Terrabacteria.",
  "abstract": "The promise of higher phylogenetic stability through increased dataset sizes within tree of life (TOL) reconstructions has not been fulfilled. Among the many possible causes are changes in species composition (taxon sampling) that could influence phylogenetic accuracy of the methods by altering the relative weight of the evolutionary histories of each individual species. This effect would be stronger in clades that are represented by few lineages, which is common in many prokaryote phyla. Indeed, phyla with fewer taxa showed the most discordance among recent TOL studies. We implemented an approach to systematically test how the identity of taxa among a larger dataset and the number of taxa included affected the accuracy of phylogenetic reconstruction. Utilizing an empirical dataset within Terrabacteria we found that even within scenarios consisting of the same number of taxa, the species used strongly affected phylogenetic stability. Furthermore, we found that trees with fewer species were more dissimilar to the tree produced from the full dataset. These results hold even when the tree is composed by many phyla and only one of them is being altered. Thus, the effect of taxon sampling in one group does not seem to be buffered by the presence of many other clades, making this issue relevant even to very large datasets. Our results suggest that a systematic evaluation of phylogenetic stability through taxon resampling is advisable even for very large datasets. https://github.com/BlabOaklandU/PATS.git.

  "title": "Breast mass detection and diagnosis using fused features with density.",
  "abstract": "The morbidity of breast cancer has been increased in these years and ranked the first of all female diseases. Computer-aided diagnosis techniques for mammograms can help radiologists find early breast lesions. In mammograms, the degree of malignancy of the tumor is not only related to its morphology and texture features, but also closely related to the density of the tumor. However, in the current research on breast masses detection and diagnosis, people usually use the fusion feature of morphology and texture but neglect density, or only the density feature is considered. Therefore, this paper proposes a method to detect and diagnose the breast mass using fused features with density. In this paper, we first propose a method based on sub-region clustering to detect the breast mass. The breast region is divided into sub-regions of equal size, and each sub-region is extracted based on local density feature, after that, an Unsupervised ELM (US-ELM) is used for clustering to complete the mass detection. Second, the feature model is constructed based on the mass. This model is composed of the mass region density feature, morphology feature and texture feature. And Genetic Algorithm is used for feature selection, and the optimized feature model is formed. Finally, ELM is used to diagnose benign or malignant mass. An experiment on the real dataset of 480 mammograms in Northeast China shows that our proposed method can effectively improve the detection and diagnosis accuracy of breast masses, where we obtained 0.9184 precision in detection of breast masses and 0.911 accuracy in diagnosis of breast masses. We have proposed a mass detection system, which achieves better detection accuracy performance than the existing state-of-art algorithm. We also propose a mass diagnosis system based on the fused features with density, which is more efficient than other feature model and classifier on the same dataset.",

  "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been used to extract critical information from unstructured clinical notes, which often include important details not captured in the structured sections of electronic health records (EHRs). This study assesses the performance of the GPT-4o LLM in extracting signs and symptoms (S&S) from clinical notes, focusing on both general and organ-specific (urological and cardiorespiratory) contexts. Clinical notes from the MTSamples corpora were manually annotated for comparison with the S&S extraction results using LLM. GPT-4o was applied to extract S&S using named entity recognition techniques. Key performance metrics-precision, recall, and F1-score-were used to evaluate and compare general and organ-specific results. The model showed high precision in general S&S extraction (78%) and achieved the highest precision for organ-specific tasks in the cardiorespiratory dataset (87%). For the urinary dataset, precision was also strong (81%), with balanced recall and F1-scores across analyses. These findings underscore GPT-4o's effectiveness in both general and domain-specific S&S extraction but highlight the need for domain-specific tuning and optimization to further improve recall and generalizability in specialized medical contexts.",

  "abstract": "We used data mining to predict the attitudes of 527 caregivers towards the pros and cons of using robotics and artificial intelligence (AI) for dementia care in African American families, with a focus on family-level factors. African American family caregivers would prefer using AI home attendant for caregiving, even though there are associated costs, and see the benefits of using AI robots to improve family dynamics, despite the need for the AI to collect sensitive data. In contrast, white family caregivers aged 25-34 are more likely to perceive the risks of using AI robots for this purpose. The proposed AI smart home system evaluates care quality and assists families in nursing home decisions. However, specific groups are hesitant to embrace its benefits. This highlights the need for in-depth research to address concerns and communicate potential advantages effectively.",

Association mining rules between medical procedures were extracted into a research-generated database and, for each pair of procedures A,B, the conditional probability P(A|B), its inverse, and the difference from its inverse (ConfDiff) were calculated. The study hypothesized that the higher the ConfDiff is, the more likely it is for A and B to be temporally ordered. The actual calendar date of each medical procedure served as ground truth. ConfDiff is the strongest predictor of %Tseq (r=0.278), followed by P(B|A) (r=0.129). This association continued to be present after controlling for the confidence, leverage and conviction metrics. Findings substantiate the assumption that, in a structured process-based domain (e.g., clinical care) if an attribute is strongly associated with another one, but not the other way around, this could imply temporality.",

  "abstract": "Protein complexes play critical roles in many aspects of biological functions. Three-dimensional (3D) structures of protein complexes are critical for gaining insights into structural bases of interactions and their roles in the biomolecular pathways that orchestrate key cellular processes. Because of the expense and effort associated with experimental determinations of 3D protein complex structures, computational docking has evolved as a valuable tool to predict 3D structures of biomolecular complexes. Despite recent progress, reliably distinguishing near-native docking conformations from a large number of candidate conformations, the so-called scoring problem, remains a major challenge. Here we present iScore, a novel approach to scoring docked conformations that combines HADDOCK energy terms with a score obtained using a graph representation of the protein-protein interfaces and a measure of evolutionary conservation. It achieves a scoring performance competitive with, or superior to, that of state-of-the-art scoring functions on two independent datasets: (i) Docking software-specific models and (ii) the CAPRI score set generated by a wide variety of docking approaches (i.e. docking software-non-specific). iScore ranks among the top scoring approaches on the CAPRI score set (13 targets) when compared with the 37 scoring groups in CAPRI. The results demonstrate the utility of combining evolutionary, topological and energetic information for scoring docked conformations. This work represents the first successful demonstration of graph kernels to protein interfaces for effective discrimination of near-native and non-native conformations of protein complexes. The iScore code is freely available from Github: https://github.com/DeepRank/iScore (DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.2630567). And the docking models used are available from SBGrid: https://data.sbgrid.org/dataset/684). Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.",

  "abstract": "Real-world evidence (RWE) is increasingly used to inform health technology assessments for resource allocation, which are valuable tools for emerging economies such as in America. Nevertheless, the characteristics and uses in South America are unknown. To identify sources, characteristics, and uses of RWE in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Chile, and evaluate the context-specific challenges. The implications for future regulation and responsible management of RWE in the region are also considered. A systematic literature review, database mapping, and targeted gray literature search were conducted to identify the sources and characteristics of RWE. Findings were validated by key opinion leaders attending workshops in 4 South American countries. A database mapping exercise revealed 407 unique databases. Geographic scope, database type, population, and outcomes captured were reported. Characteristics of national health information systems show efforts to collect interoperable data from service providers, insurers, and government agencies, but that initiatives are hampered by fragmentation, lack of stewardship, and resources. In South America, RWE is mainly used for pharmacovigilance and as pure academic research, but less so for health technology assessment decision making or pricing negotiations and not at all to inform early access schemes. The quality of real-world data in the case study countries vary and RWE is not consistently used in healthcare decision making. Authors recommend that future studies monitor the impact of digitalization and the potential effects of access to RWE on the quality of patient care.",

  "abstract": "Polo-like kinases (PLKs) are pivotal regulators of cell proliferation and cell survival; therefore, PLKs may be potential targets in the treatment of malignancy. The therapeutic effects of volasertib, a PLKs inhibitor for papillary and follicular thyroid cancer (known as well-differentiated thyroid cancer (WDTC)), were evaluated in this study. Volasertib inhibited cell proliferation in two papillary and two follicular thyroid cancer cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Volasertib treatment reduced cells in the S phase and increased cells in the G2/M phase. Volasertib activated caspase-3 activity and induced apoptosis. Drug combinations of volasertib and sorafenib showed mostly synergism in four well-differentiated thyroid carcinoma cell lines in vitro. Volasertib treatment in vivo retarded the growth of a papillary thyroid tumor model. Furthermore, the combination of volasertib with sorafenib was more effective than a single treatment of either in a follicular thyroid cancer xenograft model. Promising safety profiles appeared in animals treated with either volasertib alone or volasertib and sorafenib combination therapy. These findings support volasertib as a potential drug for the treatment of patients with WDTC.",

  "title": "[Feature distillation multiple instance learning method based on sequence reorganized Mamba].",
  "abstract": "Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent malignancies among men worldwide, and its diagnosis relies heavily on accurate analysis of whole slide imaging (WSI) in histopathology. However, manual interpretation is time-consuming and prone to inconsistent accuracy. Existing multiple instance learning (MIL)-based studies can assist diagnosis but still suffer from high computational cost, insufficient exploitation of inter-instance relationships, and neglect of tissue heterogeneity. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a feature distillation multiple instance learning method based on sequence reorganization mamba (FDMIL). The proposed approach leveraged the long-sequence modeling capability of SR-Mamba to capture effective inter-instance dependencies and heterogeneity. Meanwhile, a feature distillation mechanism was introduced to remove redundant representations and reduce computational overhead. Additionally, an auxiliary loss function was designed to mitigate pseudo-bag noise interference. We evaluated FDMIL on the Peking Union Medical College Hospital (PUMCH) prostate cancer WSI dataset and the public Camelyon16 dataset. Experimental results demonstrated that FDMIL achieved significant performance improvements on both datasets, reaching an AUC of 93.9%, ACC of 90.1%, and F1-score of 87.3%, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. These results verify the effectiveness and clinical applicability of FDMIL in both institutional and public scenarios.",

  "abstract": "This article presents a systematic review of the research progress on temporal interference (TI) electromagnetic stimulation for deep brain function modulation. It first analyzes the fundamental principle of generating low-frequency envelopes through the interference of dual-frequency electric or magnetic fields. Combined with simulation studies, this analysis reveals that TI offers superior focal specificity in deep brain regions compared with traditional transcranial electric or magnetic stimulation. The reviewed studies indicate that multi-electrode or multi-coil configurations can substantially enhance the focality and penetration of electric fields in deep brain areas. In clinical applications, TI has shown potential advantages in improving motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease, enhancing working memory, and localizing epileptic foci, though careful evaluation on TI's safety and ethical considerations remains essential. Finally, this review highlights that integrating artificial intelligence-based parameter optimization with personalized brain network modeling represents a key pathway toward overcoming current technical limitations, hoping to lay a theoretical foundation for developing closed-loop precise neuromodulation systems.",

In this study, a fuzzy logic-controlled self-tuning proportional-integral-derivative (PID) algorithm was adopted. By simultaneously adjusting three key electrical stimulation parameters-amplitude, pulse width, and frequency of the pulse signal-the distal locomotor central pattern generator (CPG) in rats with spinal cord injury (SCI) was activated, realizing real-time control of hindlimb ankle joint movement in paralyzed rats. To verify the control performance of the intraspinal microstimulation system, animal experiments were conducted. Statistical results showed that the root mean square error (RMSE) of joint angle tracking was 2.50°, and the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) was 5.78%. The results indicate that the ankle joint of the paralyzed hindlimb in SCI rats can move according to the preset angle trajectory through single-electrode intraspinal electrical stimulation.",

This study proposes a novel target localization approach that integrates electroencephalogram source imaging, brain network analysis, and a neural computational model. We analyzed electrocorticography (ECoG) data from 12 patients, quantified the epileptogenicity of epileptic network nodes, and noninvasively located optimal stimulation targets. Three source imaging methods and two brain network reconstruction measures were compared for localization performance. Among four patients with good outcomes, the method accurately localized epileptogenic tissues in three. Results of tES simulation demonstrated that cathodal direct current stimulation of the target region significantly reduced the brain network's epileptogenicity. This study provides a noninvasive, quantifiable targeting strategy for tES therapy in epilepsy patients.",

  "abstract": "Motor imagery electroencephalogram (MI-EEG) decoding algorithms face multiple challenges. These include incomplete feature extraction, susceptibility of attention mechanisms to distraction under low signal-to-noise ratios, and limited capture of long-range temporal dependencies. To address these issues, this paper proposes a multi-branch differential attention temporal network (MDAT-Net). First, the method constructed a multi-branch feature fusion module to extract and fuse diverse spatio-temporal features from different scales. Next, to suppress noise and stabilize attention, a novel multi-head differential attention mechanism was introduced to enhance key signal dynamics by calculating the difference between attention maps. Finally, an adaptive residual separable temporal convolutional network was designed to efficiently capture long-range dependencies within the feature sequence for precise classification. Experimental results showed that the proposed method achieved average classification accuracies of 85.73%, 90.04%, and 96.30% on the public datasets BCI-IV-2a, BCI-IV-2b, and HGD, respectively, significantly outperforming several baseline models. This research provides an effective new solution for developing high-precision motor imagery brain-computer interface systems.",

  "abstract": "Improper food handling among those working in retail and food service settings is a frequent contributor to foodborne illness outbreaks. Food safety training and education interventions are important strategies to improve the behaviors and behavioral precursors (e.g., knowledge and attitudes) of food handlers in these settings. We conducted a comprehensive systematic review to identify, characterize, and synthesize global studies in this area to determine the overall effectiveness of these interventions. The review focused on experimental studies with an independent control group. Review methods included structured search strategy, relevance screening of identified abstracts, characterization of relevant articles, risk of bias assessment, data extraction, meta-analysis of intervention effectiveness for four outcome categories (attitudes, knowledge, behavior, and food premise inspection scores), and a quality of evidence assessment. We identified 18 relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 29 nonrandomized trials. Among RCTs, 25 (64%) unique outcomes were rated as high risk of bias, primarily owing to concerns about outcome measurement methods, while 45 (98%) nonrandomized trial outcomes were rated as serious risk of bias, primarily because of concerns about confounding bias. High confidence was identified for the effect of training and education interventions to improve food handler knowledge outcomes in eight RCT studies (standardized mean difference = 0.92; 95% confidence interval: 0.03, 1.81; = 86%). For all other outcomes, no significant effect was identified. In contrast, nonrandomized trials identified a statistically significant positive intervention effect for all outcome types, but confidence in these findings was very low due to possible confounding and other biases. Results indicate that food safety training and education interventions are effective to improve food handler knowledge, but more evidence is needed on strategies to improve behavior change.",

  "abstract": "Background Diagnostic errors cause substantial preventable harm, but national estimates vary widely from 40,000 to 4 million annually. This cross-sectional analysis of a large medical malpractice claims database was the first phase of a three-phase project to estimate the US burden of serious misdiagnosis-related harms. Methods We sought to identify diseases accounting for the majority of serious misdiagnosis-related harms (morbidity/mortality). Diagnostic error cases were identified from Controlled Risk Insurance Company (CRICO)'s Comparative Benchmarking System (CBS) database (2006-2015), representing 28.7% of all US malpractice claims. Diseases were grouped according to the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Clinical Classifications Software (CCS) that aggregates the International Classification of Diseases diagnostic codes into clinically sensible groupings. We analyzed vascular events, infections, and cancers (the \"Big Three\"), including frequency, severity, and settings. High-severity (serious) harms were defined by scores of 6-9 (serious, permanent disability, or death) on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) Severity of Injury Scale. Results From 55,377 closed claims, we analyzed 11,592 diagnostic error cases [median age 49, interquartile range (IQR) 36-60; 51.7% female]. These included 7379 with high-severity harms (53.0% death). The Big Three diseases accounted for 74.1% of high-severity cases (vascular events 22.8%, infections 13.5%, and cancers 37.8%). In aggregate, the top five from each category (n = 15 diseases) accounted for 47.1% of high-severity cases. The most frequent disease in each category, respectively, was stroke, sepsis, and lung cancer. Causes were disproportionately clinical judgment factors (85.7%) across categories (range 82.0-88.8%). Conclusions The Big Three diseases account for about three-fourths of serious misdiagnosis-related harms. Initial efforts to improve diagnosis should focus on vascular events, infections, and cancers.",

  "abstract": "The explosion of medical imaging data along with the advent of big data analytics has launched an exciting era for clinical research. One factor affecting the ability to aggregate large medical image collections for research is the lack of infrastructure for automated data annotation. Among all imaging modalities, annotation of magnetic resonance (MR) images is particularly challenging due to the non-standard labeling of MR image types. In this work, we aimed to train a deep neural network to annotate MR image sequence type for scans of brain tumor patients. We focused on the four most common MR sequence types within neuroimaging: T1-weighted (T1W), T1-weighted post-gadolinium contrast (T1Gd), T2-weighted (T2W), and T2-weighted fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR). Our repository contains images acquired using a variety of pulse sequences, sequence parameters, field strengths, and scanner manufacturers. Image selection was agnostic to patient demographics, diagnosis, and the presence of tumor in the imaging field of view. We used a total of 14,400 two-dimensional images, each visualizing a different part of the brain. Data was split into train, validation, and test sets (9600, 2400, and 2400 images, respectively) and sets consisted of equal-sized groups of image types. Overall, the model reached an accuracy of 99% on the test set. Our results showed excellent performance of deep learning techniques in predicting sequence types for brain tumor MR images. We conclude deep learning models can serve as tools to support clinical research and facilitate efficient database management.",

  "abstract": "Emergency departments (EDs) are increasingly overcrowded. Forecasting patient visit volume is challenging. Reliable and accurate forecasting strategies may help improve resource allocation and mitigate the effects of overcrowding. Patterns related to weather, day of the week, season, and holidays have been previously used to forecast ED visits. Internet search activity has proven useful for predicting disease trends and offers a new opportunity to improve ED visit forecasting. This study tests whether Google search data and relevant statistical methods can improve the accuracy of ED volume forecasting compared with traditional data sources. Seven years of historical daily ED arrivals were collected from Boston Children's Hospital. We used data from the public school calendar, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and Google Trends. Multiple linear models using LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) for variable selection were created. The models were trained on 5 years of data and out-of-sample accuracy was judged using multiple error metrics on the final 2 years. All data sources added complementary predictive power. Our baseline day-of-the-week model recorded average percent errors of 10.99%. Autoregressive terms, calendar and weather data reduced errors to 7.71%. Search volume data reduced errors to 7.58% theoretically preventing 4 improperly staffed days. The predictive power provided by the search volume data may stem from the ability to capture population-level interaction with events, such as winter storms and infectious diseases, that traditional data sources alone miss. This study demonstrates that search volume data can meaningfully improve forecasting of ED visit volume and could help improve quality and reduce cost.",

  "abstract": "Ideally, public health policies are formulated from scientific data; however, policy-specific data are often unavailable. Big data can generate ecologically-valid, high-quality scientific evidence, and therefore has the potential to change how public health policies are formulated. Here, we discuss the use of big data for developing evidence-based hearing health policies, using data collected and analyzed with a research prototype of a data repository known as EVOTION (EVidence-based management of hearing impairments: public health pOlicy-making based on fusing big data analytics and simulaTION), to illustrate our points. Data in the repository consist of audiometric clinical data, prospective real-world data collected from hearing aids and an app, and responses to questionnaires collected for research purposes. To date, we have used the platform and a synthetic dataset to model the estimated risk of noise-induced hearing loss and have shown novel evidence of ways in which external factors influence hearing aid usage patterns. We contend that this research prototype data repository illustrates the value of using big data for policy-making by providing high-quality evidence that could be used to formulate and evaluate the impact of hearing health care policies.",

  "title": "Breast microcalcifications detection based on fusing features with DTCWT.",
  "abstract": "Breast cancer is a common disease in women. Early detection and early treatment can reduce breast cancer mortality. Studies have shown that breast cancer microcalcifications is one of the important clinical manifestations of early breast cancer, and sometimes even the only manifestation. When the mammography image shows typical malignant microcalcification, it can be diagnosed as breast cancer without any other signs of malignancy. In the aided diagnosis of microcalcifications, it is a crucial step to automatically find and locate regions of interest containing microcalcifications. However, the existing feature extraction method for microcalcifications only extracts features in the time domain or wavelet domain, and does not completely represent all the information of the region of interest. An extraction method based on the combination of Dual-Tree Complex Wavelet Transform (DTCWT) and texture features is proposed in the paper. First, the processing operations including denoising, enhancement, and edge detection were performed on mammograms. Sub-image segmentation is then performed. DTCWT features and texture features are extracted for each sub-image.DTCWT features are combined with texture features, and then genetic algorithm is used for feature optimization. The features are classified by the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) to achieve rapid detection and automatic extraction of ROI with microcalcifications. The experimental results verify that the feature model proposed in this paper has the highest detection rate for ROI regions. The ROI region extracted by the proposed feature model was used as subsequent experimental data. Three different methods were used to detect the microcalcifications, including Top-hat, wavelet transform, and methods combining Top-Hat and wavelet transform. The method was applied to 100 mammograms from the mammograms database of women in Northeast China. In the automatic extraction of ROI, the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive accuracy and negative accuracy of the proposed model combined with DTCWT were 95.92%, 96.71%, 92.20%, 93.65%, 96.33%, respectively. When the Top-hat algorithm was used for microcalcifications detection, the sensitivity reached 89.6%, and the false positive detection rate was 2.6. When the wavelet transform algorithm was used for microcalcifications detection, the sensitivity was 91.1%, and the false positive detection rate was 3.28. When the combined algorithm was used for microcalcifications detection, the sensitivity was 86.7%, and the false positive detection rate decreased to 1.35. The proposed model combined with DTCWT features achieves better result in the automatic extraction of ROI. Moreover, in the subsequent detection of microcalcifications based on three methods, the three methods achieved better results in sensitivity and false positive detection rate, respectively.",

  "abstract": "Metastatic uveal melanoma (MUM) has a poor prognosis, but hepatic arterial infusion chemotherapy (HAIC) may improve outcomes in patients with hepatic metastases. To identify reliable prognostic factors for patient stratification and treatment allocation, we analyzed the clinical and imaging data from a large single-center cohort using machine learning (ML) models. Pre- and post-first treatment clinical data of 235 patients with MUM treated with HAIC between 2009 and 2019 were retrospectively analyzed using Cox regression to identify prognostic factors for overall survival (OS) and time to change treatment strategy (TTCS). Furthermore, ML models were trained on clinical and computed tomography (CT) data for endpoint prediction. Pre-treatment multi-variate analysis identified elevated lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (OS: 6.5 vs. 16.4 months, hazard ratio [HR]) = 1.87, P = 0.006) and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) (OS: 7.6 vs. 16.4 months, HR = 1.67, P = 0.012) as prognostic factors for inferior OS. Decreased albumin (TTCS: 1.3 vs. 6.1 months, HR = 6.26, P < 0.001) and elevated LDH (TTCS: 2.9 vs. 7.6 months, HR = 1.72, P = 0.011) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (TTCS: 3.7 vs. 6.4 months, HR = 1.65, P = 0.004) predicted shorter TTCS. Scoring enhanced the power of the prognosticators for OS and TTCS. Post-first treatment multi-variate analysis emphasized the importance of inflammation management and liver protection. ML models incorporating radiomics features from baseline CT imaging were not superior to models based on pre-treatment clinical data alone. We identified independent but synergistic prognostic factors for outcome stratification to guide treatment decisions and optimize patient management. ML-based radiomics features did not significantly enhance prognostic performance.",

  "abstract": "With the advancement of genomic technologies, precision lifestyle interventions tailored to individual genetic backgrounds have emerged as a novel approach for preventing and managing chronic diseases such as obesity. Several randomized controlled trials (RCTs) targeting obese or overweight populations have found that individuals with different genotypes exhibit varying responses to the same lifestyle intervention (gene-lifestyle intervention interactions). To date, more than 20 genes, including and , have been identified to show such interactions, suggesting that genotype-based precision nutrition is a feasible approach. Based on this, some RCTs have compared the effectiveness of genotype-based precision interventions and one-fits-all interventions. However, current study results show considerable heterogeneity, and it remains inconclusive whether precision interventions are superior to one-fits-all interventions. Future studies should further explore precision intervention strategies, particularly by taking polygenic effects into account and integrating multi-omics data using methods such as machine learning, to provide new insights for precision interventions.",

  "title": "Clinical advances in curve of Spee assessment: Deep learning for automatic tooth landmark detection in Invisalign.",
  "abstract": "The curve of Spee (COS) is a key indicator of occlusal function and orthodontic outcomes. Its measurement traditionally relies on manual landmark identification from intraoral scans, which is time-consuming and operator-dependent. This study introduces a deep learning-based method for fully automated COS assessment based on intraoral scan data, aiming to improve measurement efficiency and support the evaluation of the predictability of COS leveling in patients with varying vertical skeletal patterns undergoing Invisalign treatment (Align Technology, Santa Clara, Calif). In this retrospective study, a total of 194 mandibular arch models were used to train and validate an automated network for measuring COS. This network adopted a Structure-Aware Long Short-Term Memory framework, which employed a 2-stage method for detecting coarse and fine tooth landmarks to assess COS depth. The accuracy of the landmarks was evaluated using the mean radial error and success detection rate, whereas COS depth was assessed using the paired Wilcoxon test. Finally, 55 patients with different vertical skeletal patterns were selected to analyze differences in COS leveling effects. In addition, the extrusion of teeth relative to the occlusal plane was compared. The proposed network closely approximated the manual method, with the mean radial error for landmark detection being 0.32 ± 0.09 mm. The median measurement error for COS was 0.05 mm (P <0.001). ClinCheck predicted an average of 0.24 mm higher COS leveling than the actual outcome (P <0.01). The hyperdivergent group exhibited the highest predictability at 69%, whereas the hypodivergent group showed the lowest predictability at 58%. The accuracy of extrusion relative to the occlusal plane at the first molar was the lowest (65%). Deep learning can aid in measuring COS. In ClinCheck, considering various vertical skeletal patterns is necessary when designing the leveling objectives for COS, with the first molar requiring particular attention.",

  "abstract": "Integrating machine learning (ML) techniques in established numerical solvers represents a modern approach to enhance computational fluid dynamics simulations. Within the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM), the collision operator serves as an ideal entry point to incorporate machine learning (ML) techniques to enhance its accuracy and stability. In this work, an invariant neural network is constructed, acting on an equivariant collision operator, optimizing the relaxation rates of nonphysical moments. This optimization enhances robustness to symmetry transformations and ensures consistent behavior across geometric operations. The proposed neural collision operator (NCO) is trained using forced isotropic turbulence simulations driven by spectral forcing, ensuring stable turbulence statistics. The desired performance is achieved by minimizing the energy spectrum discrepancy between direct numerical simulations and underresolved simulations over a specified wave number range. The loss function is further extended to tailor numerical dissipation at high wave numbers, ensuring robustness without compromising accuracy at low and intermediate wave numbers. The NCO's performance is demonstrated using three-dimensional Taylor-Green vortex (TGV) flows, where it accurately predicts the dynamics even in highly underresolved simulations. Compared to other LBM models, such as the BGK and KBC operators, the NCO exhibits improved accuracy while maintaining stability. In addition, the operator shows robust performance in alternative configurations, including turbulent three-dimensional cylinder flow. Finally, an alternative training procedure using time-dependent quantities is introduced. It is based on a reduced TGV model along with newly proposed symmetry boundary conditions. The reduction in memory consumption enables training at significantly higher Reynolds numbers, successfully leading to stable yet accurate simulations.",

  "title": "Learning transitions to extreme events using reservoir computing.",
  "abstract": "Predicting extreme events is a challenging task due to their occasional appearance at irregular time intervals and with sudden large amplitudes. In particular, accurate forecasting of both the amplitude and timing of occurrence is difficult. We make an attempt to address the challenges using reservoir computing machine learning based on partial or complete information of the system variables in a few paradigmatic dynamical systems, namely, the forced Liénard system, the coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo model, and a model of hidden attractor. The efficacy of the machine learning approach has been tested using numerically generated data using models and a real-time experiment. The machine is able to successfully predict the transition points to extreme events via two well-known nonlinear processes, namely, Pomeau-Manneville intermittency and crisis-induced intermittency (interior crisis) against a system parameter by reconstruction of the bifurcation diagram by training the machine with simulated data. The machine is able to retrace the attractors of the systems quite efficiently and also reproduce the distributions of events and interevent intervals, thereby preserving the statistical properties of extreme events in the model systems. Prediction of time evolution is still limited to the length of a few Lyapunov times before it diverges from the original state as expected due to the complex nature of the extreme event dynamics. The amplitude of extreme events in the time series is preserved or predicted almost accurately. A prediction horizon metric is used for measuring the success level of the machine and deciding the minimal number of inputs necessary for efficient learning and prediction of the forced Liénard system and the hidden attractor model. For the coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo model, we use the mean square error measure to find an appropriate choice of a pair of inputs that is necessary for successful prediction. Using experimental data from an analog forced Liénard circuit, so far the machine could learn the dynamics and the long-term statistics of extreme events originating via Pomeau-Manneville intermittency.",

  "abstract": "Renyi entropy with multiple disjoint intervals are computed from the improved swapping operations by two methods: One is from the direct diagonalization of the Hamiltonian and the other one is from the state-of-the-art machine learning method with neural networks. We use the paradigmatic transverse-field Ising model in one dimension to demonstrate the strategy of the improved swapping operation. In particular, we study the second Renyi entropy with two, three, and four disjoint intervals. We find that the results from the above two methods match each other very well within errors, which indicates that the machine learning method is applicable for calculating the Renyi entropy with multiple disjoint intervals. Moreover, as the magnetic field increases, the Renyi entropy grows as well until the system arrives at the critical point of the phase transition. However, as the magnetic field exceeds the critical value, the Renyi entropy will decrease since the system enters the paramagnetic phase. Overall, these results match the theoretical predictions very well and demonstrate the high accuracy of the machine learning methods with neural networks.",

  "title": "Accuracy and limitations of machine-learned interatomic potentials for magnetic systems: A case study on Fe-Cr-C.",
  "abstract": "Machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) are rapidly becoming the standard for atomistic simulations, but their application to magnetic materials remains challenging because spin fluctuations must be treated either explicitly or implicitly. Here, we investigate this problem for the technologically important Fe-Cr-C system by constructing two deep machine learning potentials within the DeePMD framework: one trained on nonmagnetic DFT data (DP-NM) and one on spin-polarized DFT data (DP-M). Extensive validation against experiments reveals that DP-NM accurately reproduces dynamic, collective properties such as viscosity and melting temperatures, while DP-M excels in describing static, local properties such as density, especially for Fe-rich alloys. We rationalize these findings by noting that, at high temperatures, local magnetic moments self-average over space and time, making explicit spin treatment unnecessary for transport properties but essential for equilibrium volumes. To mitigate the high cost of spin-polarized DFT sampling, we employ a transfer-learning strategy, pretraining on nonmagnetic data followed by fine-tuning on a small spin-polarized dataset, which reduces computational expense by more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, we benchmark several state-of-the-art foundation models: MACE, GRACE, DPA3 and fine-tuned variants of the latter against our specialized potentials. We find that foundation models offer competitive accuracy after fine-tuning but remain significantly slower in molecular dynamics simulations, limiting their practicality for large-scale transport property calculations. Our results establish clear design principles for MLIPs targeting magnetic alloys: (i) nonmagnetic training data suffice for dynamic properties of paramagnetic melts, and (ii) spin-polarized training is essential only for precise static properties of ferromagnetic phases. These insights provide a roadmap for efficient development of transferable MLIPs for magnetic systems and clarify the role of foundation models and transfer learning in accelerating this process.",

  "title": "Sustaining the chaotic dynamics of the Kuramoto model by adaptable reservoir computer.",
  "abstract": "A scenario frequently encountered in real-world complex systems is the temporary failure of a few components. For spatially extended chaotic systems whose functionality hinges on the collective dynamics of the interacting components, a viable approach to dealing with the failures is replacing the malfunctioning components with their backups, so that the collective dynamics of the systems can be precisely maintained for a duration long enough to resolve the problem. Here, taking the chaotic dynamics of the paradigmatic Kuramoto model as an example and considering the scenario of oscillator failures, we propose substituting the failed oscillators with digital twins trained by the data measured from the system evolution. Specifically, leveraging the technique of an adaptable reservoir computer (RC) in machine learning, we demonstrate that a single, small-size RC can substitute any oscillator in the Kuramoto model such that the time evolution of the synchronization order parameter of the repaired system is identical to that of the original system for a certain time period. The performance of adaptable RC is evaluated in various contexts, and it is found that the sustaining period is influenced by multiple factors, including the size of the training dataset, the overall coupling strength of the system, and the number of substituted oscillators. Additionally, though the synchronization order parameter diverges from the ground truth in the long-term running, the functional networks of the oscillators are still faithfully sustained by the machine substitutions.",

  "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) manifests through diverse clinical forms, each necessitating specific care approaches. Detecting both underlying pathology and precise clinical phenotype is critical to address the full spectrum of symptoms and provide tailored care. Logopenic variant of primary progressive aphasia (lvPPA) evolutive prognosis is particularly challenging. This syndrome presents dominant language AD-like symptoms with different underlying pathologies such as AD or frontotemporal-lobar-degeneration (FTLD). Current diagnosis requires a multidisciplinary approach, combining CSF (Cerebro-Spinal Fluid) analysis, imaging, and psychometric assessments. Speech markers were identified as valuable tools for distinguishing clinical diagnoses. This study evaluates their potential for cross-classifying AD-phenotypes with CSF-profiles, providing a non-invasive method for early prognosis of neurodegenerative evolution. This study included 42 patients classified into three groups based on clinical phenotype and CSF biomarker profiles: lvPPA- (n = 10, underlying FTLD), lvPPA+ (n = 12, underlying AD), and AD (n = 20). Participants completed a 14 sentence repetitions task at diagnostic stage. Speech recordings were analyzed at both patient and sentence-specific levels. Prosodic and temporal features were extracted and used to train supervised machine learning models (Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Support Vector Machine). Then, these models were parameterized to classify both clinical phenotypes and underlying pathologies of AD phenotypes. Cross-validation (70/30 split) and hyperparameter tuning optimized model performance. The three groups exhibited similar demographic profiles but significantly distinct clinical and pathological characteristics. Among the models tested, Random Forest demonstrated the most efficient and balanced performance, achieving a cross-validation accuracy of 91%. It differentiated lvPPA-, lvPPA+, and AD groups, with precision scores outperforming other models. These findings suggest that speech-based classification can serve as a valuable tool for an early prognostic identification of both clinical phenotypes and underlying pathology, offering a non-invasive tool for refining diagnostic precision at early-stage of Alzheimer's disease trajectories. Speech-based classification provides valuable early prognostic insights by linking clinical phenotypes with CSF profiles at onset time. By enhancing prognostic precision, such tools could improve early intervention strategies to counter disease progression. However, larger studies and advanced classification approaches are essential to confirm these findings and validate speech classification as a reliable, non-invasive tool for early differential prognosis.",

  "title": "Revealing the role of local octahedral distortions in hybrid halide perovskites through physical-informed data-driven machine learning.",
  "abstract": "Data-driven material designs often encounter challenges from small and imbalanced datasets. The complex structural and physicochemical properties of hybrid halide perovskites, coupled with these limitations, create obstacles for performing feature engineering and extracting key fingerprints. Herein, we employed a physical-informed data-driven modeling approach to identify lattice geometric fingerprints, such as the distortion index (DI) and effective coordination number (ECoN), and to establish a robust structure-property relationship mapping the electronic bandgap, resulting in improved model performance. Lattice compression simulations across multiple phases of MAPbI3 further confirmed a strong correlation between DI and ECoN with the electronic bandgap, validating the robustness of the selected octahedra geometrical fingerprints. By adjusting the s-p antibonding coupling, the pressure-driven reduction in local octahedral distortion, induced by the anisotropic hydrogen bonding between the inorganic framework and organic cation, narrows the electronic bandgap and facilitates the p-p transitions, thereby boosting the transition dipole moment and band-edge absorption. Combining data mining with physical analysis, we have successfully clarified the significant impact of lattice geometry on the electronic properties and identified key octahedral geometric fingerprints for effectively describing the electronic bandgap, while also revealing the microphysical mechanisms of local octahedral distortion on the optoelectronic properties of hybrid halide perovskites.",

  "abstract": "Monitoring adverse drug events (ADEs) is critical for pharmacovigilance and patient safety. However, identifying ADEs remains challenging, as suspected or confirmed side effects are often documented solely in the unstructured text of electronic health records (EHRs). Manually reviewing clinical notes to detect ADEs is labor-intensive and time-consuming, highlighting the need for automated methods capable of analyzing and extracting ADE-related information from clinical documentation. In this short communication, we describe our ongoing research on fine-tuning and evaluating a large language model (LLM) for the detection of ADEs in clinical notes. Preliminary descriptive result of this study indicates that ADEs are poorly documented in discharge notes, with less than 15% explicitly linking ADEs to specific drugs, which highlights the need for improved reporting practices.",

  "abstract": "Bridging diverse terminologies and ensuring precise information retrieval, semantic similarity in medical language is key to improve healthcare outcomes. Semantic similarity measures how closely pieces of text share the same meaning, a crucial element in Natural Language Processing (NLP) for better understanding and interpreting data. While Large Language Models (LLMs) are known for their versatility and text generation abilities, BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) excels at text analysis and identifying semantic similarities. However, as AI models become more advanced, researchers face challenges related to model size, computational demands, and deployment constraints (e.g., energy, memory, and latency). To address these issues, model optimization techniques can drastically reduce memory usage and speed up inference. In this work, we leverage the open-source Microsoft Olive tool to find the best optimizations, then apply a dynamic quantization process. We evaluate our approach on the DEFT 2020 Text Mining Challenge, slightly improving performance metrics while achieving a 20x average speed-up and reducing memory usage by around 70%.",

Female investigators, along with individuals from diverse backgrounds and identities, generate novel, impactful, and innovative research, whereas biases may affect their chances of publication. In this article, we present ad hoc strategies for classifying biomedical manuscripts according to four dimensions (experimental designs, medical specialties, sample sizes and funding sources). This classification is intended to further explore how gender bias may affect publication acceptance by adjusting the analyses for these important confounders. 56 manuscripts were manually annotated by two experts to assess the performance of the models. The proposed strategies performed well (compared to the inter-annotator agreement) with accuracy scores of 75%, 78%, 78% and 82%, for the above-mentioned dimensions, respectively. Given the timely importance of such questions in research, we are planning to apply the categorization at the scale of MEDLINE.",

  "abstract": "Adverse drug event (ADE) detection in social media texts poses significant challenges due to the informal nature of the text and the limited availability of annotations. The scarcity of ADE named entity recognition (NER) datasets for social media hinders the development of robust ADE detection models for this type of corpus. In this paper, we leveraged the generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to create synthetic data, addressing this dataset gap. Specifically, we generated 17,000 tweets with ADE annotations and pre-trained NER models on this synthetic data. Our evaluations on an out-of-sample collection of 915 manually annotated tweets revealed that these models outperform state-of-the-art lexico-based and massively pre-trained open NER models. We also show that fine-tuning our synthetically pre-trained models on human-annotated data surpasses the current state-of-the-art in ADE detection on tweets. These findings suggest that synthetic data generated by LLMs can enhance ADE detection performance, offering a promising avenue to explore in response to the scarcity of annotated ADE datasets. The synthetic dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/anthonyyazdaniml/synthetic-ner-ade-tweets-v1.",

  "abstract": "The diverse data sources in hospitals are crucial for real-world evidence (RWE) analysis and for developing decision support systems. However, integrating this variety of sources into standardized data collections for a specific disease, requires the development of highly personalized frameworks. In this study, we propose a RWE approach for the development of a Data Mart for the Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) at the Gemelli hospital of Rome. Our approach combines natural language processing and data mining procedures to capture information about organ involvements, activity episodes and treatments, under rules defined by physicians. The Gemelli SLE Data Mart includes 262 SLE patients with at least a hospitalization from 2012 to 2020, and an outpatient visit, with a total amount of 5962 contacts. We also developed a visualization tool to display each patient longitudinally and we performed a data-driven analysis to stratify patients into progression groups, based on their involved organs and flares. The Gemelli SLE Data Mart and its framework were useful to build up a standardized data collection, to be used for further personalized medicine applications.",

  "abstract": "The aim of this study was to review the potential of electronic health record (EHR) data to automatically identify key concepts related to patient satisfaction in cardiac care. A randomised sample of EHR data from 500 cardiac patients were screened for feature extraction, identifying 187 terms describing patient satisfaction. The predictive positive value (PPV) for positive descriptions was high, indicating the value of EHRs and narrative documentation when developing tools to measure patient satisfaction. The high number of false positives resulting from the automated screening and the low PPVs for negative descriptions call for more sophisticated methods to identify not only the used terms, but also their context to increase the reliability of future tools aimed at automated monitoring of patient satisfaction.",

  "abstract": "Evidence for the association between screen time and insufficient sleep is bourgeoning, and recent findings suggest that these associations may be more pronounced in younger compared to older children, and for portable compared to non-portable devices. However, these effects have yet to be investigated within the beginning of life. Importantly, there are no data for the relationship between screen exposure and objectively measured infant sleep. This study examined the moderating role of age for both touchscreens' and television's relationship with sleep, using auto-videosomnography within a big-data sample of infants. The sleep of 1074 infants (46% girls) aged 0-18 months was objectively assessed using computer-vision technology in this cross-sectional study. Sleep was additionally reported by parents in an online survey, as was infant exposure to screens. Age significantly moderated the relationship between daytime touchscreen exposure and sleep with a distinct pattern for younger infants, in which screen exposure was associated with decreased daytime sleep, but with a proposed compensatory increase in nighttime sleep consolidation. Compared to touchscreens, television exposure was less likely to be associated with sleep metrics, and age moderated this relationship only for daytime and 24-hour sleep duration. In young infants, a daytime-nighttime sleep \"trade-off\" emerged, suggesting that the displacement of daytime sleep by screens may lead to greater accumulation of sleep homeostatic pressure, which in turn facilitates more consolidated nighttime sleep.",

  "abstract": "Motivated by applications in precision medicine and treatment effect heterogeneity, recent research has focused on estimating conditional average treatment effects (CATEs) using machine learning (ML). CATE estimates may represent complicated functions that provide little insight into the key drivers of heterogeneity. Therefore, we introduce nonparametric treatment effect variable importance measures (TE-VIMs), based on the mean-squared error (MSE) in predicting the individual treatment effect. More precisely, TE-VIMs represent the increase in MSE when variables are removed from the CATE conditioning set. We derive efficient TE-VIM estimators which can be used with any CATE estimation strategy and are amenable to ML estimation. We propose several strategies to calculate these VIMs (eg, leave-one out, or keep-one in), using popular meta-learners for the CATE. We study the finite sample performance through a simulation study and illustrate their application using clinical trial data.",

  "abstract": "Heterogeneous treatment effect models allow us to compare treatments at subgroup levels and are becoming increasingly popular in applications such as personalized medicine, advertising, and education. Regardless of the type of responses (continuous, binary, count, survival), most causal estimands focus on the differences between the treatment and control conditional means. In this paper, we propose an alternative estimand, DINA-the DIfference in NAtural parameters-to quantify heterogeneous treatment effects motivated by exponential families and the Cox model. Despite the type of responses, DINA is both convenient and more practical for modeling the influence of covariates on the treatment effect. Additionally, we introduce a meta-algorithm for DINA, enabling practitioners to utilize powerful off-the-shelf machine learning tools for the estimation of nuisance functions. This meta-algorithm is also statistically robust to errors in the nuisance function estimation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method in combination with various machine learning base-learners on both simulated and real datasets.",

  "abstract": "Pupillometry has recently emerged as a sensitive biomarker for autonomic and cortical activity, offering a non-invasive readout for neuromodulation research. However, existing commercial and deep learning-based pupillometry systems are primarily designed for humans, rendering them unsuitable for rodent experiments due to differences in ocular morphology, fur-induced optical artifacts, and the computational demands of high-resolution imaging. In this study, we present a low-cost, integrated real-time rodent pupillometry system built on an embedded platform. The proposed rule-based pupillometry algorithm was optimized with adaptive ellipse fitting, RGB masking artifact suppression, and greedy tracking, achieving robust performance under infrared illumination without requiring GPU acceleration. By minimizing errors caused by complex fur patterns and rodent-specific ocular features, our approach achieved an 86.0% detection rate in rat pupillometry, substantially surpassing the 63.1% attained by existing approach. The system was validated in vivo through vagus nerve stimulation (VNS) experiments in Long-Evans rats, where dynamic changes in pupil size reliably reflected stimulation intensity. By enabling an effective evaluation of VNS, these findings highlight the utility of our system as a practical preclinical tool and underscore the broader potential of pupillometry as a non-invasive biomarker for neuromodulation.",

Closed-loop intracranial brain stimulation systems can now detect neural biomarkers of disease in real-time and therapeutically stimulate the brain based on these signals. Research devices can measure neural data on the order of single neurons and transform these data, via machine learning algorithms, into cursor movements and keyboard clicks, so that a quadriplegic patient can control a robotic arm. It is still a challenge to find the important brain signals of interest, that encode a patient's intentions or needs. Furthermore, the ethics of developing devices that allow for human cognitive and physical enhancement should be a part of societal discussion.

  "title": "Fibrosis index predicts variceal bleeding and reduces need for nonselective beta-blocker in compensated cirrhosis with initial small esophageal varices without red-color sign.",
  "abstract": "Various non-invasive markers predicting hepatic fibrosis are poor predictors of esophageal variceal bleeding (EVB). Elastography performs well but resource-limited. Controversy for small EV prevention also exists. We aim to investigate if a non-invasive marker could predict subsequent EVB within 1 and 2 years in patients with compensated liver cirrhosis (CLC), initial small EV without red-color sign (RCS), without use of non-selective beta-blockers (NSBB) and endoscopic variceal ligation (EVL). This marker would also be tested if it could help reduce use of NSBB, thereby avoiding potential side effects and saving medical costs. In this retrospective cohort study, 6,803 CLC patients fulfilling the inclusion-exclusion criteria were enrolled between 2001 and 2018, and were followed-up for 1 year, 2 years. The primary outcomes were subsequent EVB within 1 and 2 years of enrollment. Another 281 CLC patients with NSBB use were compared for additional outcome analysis. In total, 539 patients and 710 patients experienced EVB within 1 year and 2 years, respectively. The fibrosis index (FI) with cut-off value of 3.95 showed a negative predictive value (NPV) of 94.3% and an area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) of 62.95% for predicting subsequent EVB within 1 year. The EVB and mortality of patients with FI <3.95 and not taking NSBB were significantly lower than those of the other 3 groups. Similar results were demonstrated within 2 years. In CLC patients with initial small EV and no RCS, low FI scores showed a high NPV and moderate AUROC in predicting subsequent EVB and mortalities, signifying clinically non-significant portal hypertension. Patients with low FI scores and not taking NSBB had significantly lowest EVB and mortality. The medical cost savings for cutting NSBB in these patients would be estimated at least $3 million per year in the U.S. Further randomized control trial study needed to validate this screening tool.",

  "title": "SDoH-GPT: using large language models to extract social determinants of health.",
  "abstract": "Extracting social determinants of health (SDoHs) from medical notes depends heavily on labor-intensive annotations, which are typically task-specific, hampering reusability and limiting sharing. Here, we introduce SDoH-GPT, a novel framework leveraging few-shot learning large language models (LLMs) to automate the extraction of SDoH from unstructured text, aiming to improve both efficiency and generalizability. SDoH-GPT is a framework including the few-shot learning LLM methods to extract the SDoH from medical notes and the XGBoost classifiers which continue to classify SDoH using the annotations generated by the few-shot learning LLM methods as training datasets. The unique combination of the few-shot learning LLM methods with XGBoost utilizes the strength of LLMs as great few shot learners and the efficiency of XGBoost when the training dataset is sufficient. Therefore, SDoH-GPT can extract SDoH without relying on extensive medical annotations or costly human intervention. Our approach achieved tenfold and twentyfold reductions in time and cost, respectively, and superior consistency with human annotators measured by Cohen's kappa of up to 0.92. The innovative combination of LLM and XGBoost can ensure high accuracy and computational efficiency while consistently maintaining 0.90+ AUROC scores. This study has verified SDoH-GPT on three datasets and highlights the potential of leveraging LLM and XGBoost to revolutionize medical note classification, demonstrating its capability to achieve highly accurate classifications with significantly reduced time and cost. The key contribution of this study is the integration of LLM with XGBoost, which enables cost-effective and high quality annotations of SDoH. This research sets the stage for SDoH can be more accessible, scalable, and impactful in driving future healthcare solutions.",

  "abstract": "This integrative review aims to synthesize and update the current literature on mHealth applications and devices, such as smartphones, wearables, and breathalyzers, in alcohol use disorder (AUD) monitoring. It discusses the evolution of these tools, the current level of evidence, and facilitators and barriers to their implementation in research and interventions. The future potential for personalized interventions is also explored. Integrative review. Three databases-PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO-were used to identify quantitative and qualitative English written publications between 2014 and 2024, using terms related to mHealth, remote monitoring, and AUD. Results were extracted and comprehensively presented by topic. Fifty-eight studies were included in the synthesis. Smartphones, mobile phones, breathalyzers, and wearables with transdermal sensors are the most frequently used devices for remote monitoring. The included studies demonstrated varying levels of development and evidence across devices. Ecological Momentary Assessment via smartphones was the most frequently used and, along with breathalyzers, was successfully applied in clinical trials involving interventions. Wearables were scarcely tested in interventions. Challenges related to adherence and psychological factors remain in a longer period of monitoring. Incipient use of predictive models integrating ongoing data shows promise in informing care providers and optimizing intervention delivery. Evidence supporting mHealth tools for AUD remains uneven across device types. While smartphones and breathalyzers show greater clinical applicability, wearables and passive sensing remain exploratory. Robust, comparative research is needed to guide effective selection and integration into care.",

  "title": "Effects of Fluoroquinolones on Outcomes of Patients With Aortic Dissection or Aneurysm.",
  "abstract": "Recent population-based studies have revealed that the use of fluoroquinolones (FQs) is associated with an increased risk of aortic dissection (AD) and aneurysm (AA). However, no evidence is available on whether FQs increase adverse events in patients who had been diagnosed with AD or AA. This study investigated whether the use of FQs increases the risk of aortic-related adverse events and death in this high-risk population. A retrospective cohort study was conducted by using the Taiwan National Health Insurance Research Database. A total of 31,570 adult patients who survived after admission for AD or AA between 2001 and 2013 were identified. We divided each calendar year into 6 data units (2 months) for each patient and each year during follow-up. Covariates and exposure of interest (FQs) were reassessed every 2 months. We used another common antibiotic, amoxicillin, as a negative control exposure. Exposure to FQs was associated with a higher risk of all-cause death (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.61; 95% confidence interval: 1.50 to 1.73), aortic death (adjusted hazard ratio: 1.80; 95% confidence interval: 1.50 to 2.15), and later aortic surgery. However, amoxicillin exposure was not significantly associated with risk of any of the outcomes. A subgroup analysis revealed that the effect of FQs was not significantly different between the AD and AA groups. Relative to amoxicillin use, FQ exposure in patients with AD or AA was associated with a higher risk of adverse outcomes. FQs should not be used by high-risk patients unless no other treatment options are available.",

  "title": "Digital Ethics in Nursing: A Scoping Review.",
  "abstract": "To map the digital ethics studies published to date in the field of nursing. The integration of digitalization in the healthcare sector, especially in nursing care, is increasing. However, digitalization in nursing can raise professional, personal, and ethical concerns among nurses. A thorough discussion of digital ethics in nursing is still lacking in the literature. A scoping review was registered in the Open Science Framework and reported here according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses for Scoping Reviews guidelines. The PubMed, CINAHL, and Scopus databases were searched. The reference lists of included studies were also screened. The results were summarized and discussed using the patterns, advances, gaps, evidence, and recommendations methodology. A total of 394 studies were identified, of which seven met the inclusion criteria and were included. Digital ethics have been investigated in the nursing field around three main themes: (i) knowledge and awareness of digital ethics; (ii) digital ethical violations in nursing care; and (iii) digital ethical violations regarding ethical principles. Overall, the concept of digital ethics in nursing is still in its early stages. It should be further developed and harmonized to help researchers search the literature and clinicians find available evidence. Additionally, the patterns identified in studies can serve as the basis for a digital ethics framework, which should be further refined. Digital technologies present several potential ethical implications at the (a) individual levels, affecting nurses and patients, and (b) collective levels, impacting all nurses, health systems, and citizens. Increasing awareness and knowledge, and developing guidelines specific to nursing, should be a priority to prevent and minimize risks. Codes of conduct should address these emerging issues and promote the ethical use of digital tools. Audits and monitoring systems should be established to detect additional risks and address them appropriately.",

  "abstract": "Neurodegenerative disorders influence millions of people worldwide, and uncovering the pathogenesis is of urgent need. Many efforts have been made to detect or predict neurodegenerative disorders, while exploring the pathogenesis has been ignored from a systemic perspective. To handle this issue, we propose a novel and powerful method, referred to as Pathogenesis-aware Mutual-Assistance Classification and Regression Optimization (Pa-MACRO). First, Pa-MACRO incorporates a mutual-assistance bidirectional mapping technique with a joint-embedding fine-grained interpretability module. This can extract the intrinsic factors and their interactions of multimodal pathogenesis. Second, our method can simultaneously classify an at-risk individual and predict the severity triggered by neurodegenerative disorders. Furthermore, to address the small sample size issue and the high-dimensional issue, we meticulously incorporate a semi-supervised cooperative learning method to integrate unlabeled data and extend it to a chromosome-wide setting in the spirit of divide-and-conquer. The Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database was used to evaluate Pa-MACRO. Without bells and whistles, Pa-MACRO establishes new state-of-the-art results in various settings while maintaining superior interpretability, verifying its power and versatility in revealing the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. The software is publicly available at https://github.com/ZJ-Techie/Pa-MACRO.",

  "abstract": "To explore the epidemiological characteristics, imaging findings, pulmonary function changes, dust exposure situations, and treatment outcomes of accelerated silicosis through an analysis of existing literature. In December 2024, relevant literature from January 1, 1965 to December 15, 2024 was retrieved through the China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Database, VIP Database, EMbase, and PubMed databases. Keywords included \"rapidly progressive silicosis\" \"accelerated silicosis\" \"subacute silicosis\"\"artificial stone\" and related terms. By incorporating, analyzing, and retrieving data from literatures, a comprehensive review of the epidemiology, clinical features, treatment options, and prognosis of fast forward silicosis was conducted. A total of 72 literatures were included, including 23 cohort studies, 28 case reports, 3 case-control studies, and 18 cross-sectional studies. The average age of all 1794 patients was 33.67 years, with an average dust exposure duration of 5.58 years. The primary occupations associated with accelerated silicosis were stone processing, mining, and artificial quartz stone manufacturing. Imaging findings predominantly included small nodules, ground-glass opacities, and massive fibrosis. Antifibrotic treatment at the early stage of the disease could clearly delay disease progression. However, dust concentrations in workplaces were significantly above safety limits, with inadequate protective measures. Accelerated silicosis is characterized by its rapid onset, swift progression, and unfavorable prognosis. However, it has not garnered adequate attention in the present context. Reliable standard and guidelines are urgently needed to guide clinical diagnosis and treatment.",

  "abstract": "Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has been widely adopted in clinical imaging to reduce radiation exposure. However, the inherent quantum noise and streaking artifacts in LDCT markedly degrade image quality, thereby compromising diagnostic accuracy. While conventional model-based iterative denoising (MBIR) approaches effectively mitigate noise via rigorous physical modeling, their adoption is hindered by substantial computational overhead. Deep learning-based approaches demonstrate strong denoising capabilities but face challenges in generalizing across imaging scanners and protocols. In this study, we propose the Dual-Interactive Fusion Network framework (DIFNet) for LDCT images, integrating the Dual-Phase Denoising Architecture (DPDA), Context-Aware Training Strategy (CATS), and a combined dual-phase loss function. On two in‑house LDCT datasets acquired with different Philips scanners, our approach reduces noise and artifacts while preserving essential anatomical detail and outperforms established denoising methods such as RED CNN, EDCNN, DDPM, and CTformer in both qualitative evaluation and quantitative metrics. Evaluation on the public Mayo-2016 benchmark, collected using a Siemens scanner, confirms DIFNet's robust and competitive performance. Ablation experiments further validate the effectiveness of our overall network design and the contribution of its core components. Our findings highlight the potential of DIFNet for real-world clinical applications, improving diagnostic reliability and patient care. The proposed framework advances LDCT denoising by balancing performance, robustness, and computational efficiency.",

  "title": "Identification of Potential Ferroptosis Biomarkers in Multiple Myeloma via WGCNA and Experiments.",
  "abstract": "Multiple myeloma is a common malignant tumor of the hematologic system, and genetic alterations play a crucial role in its occurrence and development. Ferroptosis is an oxidative and iron-dependent programmed cell death, which has a strong correlation with tumor development. This study aimed to identify potential diagnostic ferroptosis-related genes of MM. MM datasets were screened from the GEO database using publicly available transcriptomic data. Ferroptosis-related hub genes were identified through enrichment analysis, WGCNA, and machine learning algorithms. ROC curves, boxplots, RT-qPCR, and ELISA were conducted to validate the expression levels of these hub genes. A total of 178 ferroptosis-related DEGs were identified, including 114 up-regulated genes and 64 down-regulated genes. Enrichment analysis indicated that the DEGs were primarily associated with stress, autophagy, and metabolism. According to the WGCNA, the brown module has the highest correlation with clinical symptoms, containing 1141 DEGs. Combining with the identified ferroptosis-related DEGs, two hub genes of CDKN1A and BCAT2 were identified by multiple bioinformatics techniques of LASSO, SVM, and Random Forest. ROC curves demonstrated strong diagnostic values in CDKN1A (test set, AUC = 0.881; validation set, AUC = 0.705) and BCAT2 (test set, AUC = 0.808; validation set, AUC = 0.756). RT-qPCR confirmed that the mRNA expression levels of CDKN1A and BCAT2 in three MM cells (RPMI 8226, WT-U266, and LP-1) were both significantly higher than the control HMy2.CIR cell line (p < 0.05). ELISA quantification revealed significantly elevated relative expression of CDKN1A protein in the MM cohort compared to healthy controls (p < 0.01), but the protein expression of BCAT2 exhibited comparable levels (p > 0.05). Our results suggest that CDKN1A and BCAT2 are potential ferroptosis-related biomarkers for MM. This may help understand the molecular mechanisms and therapeutic strategies of MM.",

  "abstract": "Fluorescence microscopy contrast and resolution can be greatly improved through deconvolution. Deep unfolding deconvolution networks have recently received significant attention by combining the interpretability of traditional models with enhanced reconstruction efficiency and quality through data-driven learning. However, the proliferation of network layers complicates computation, reduces the interpretability of the model, and requires more training data with increasing network parameters. In this study, we present the accelerated Richardson-Lucy network (ARLN), which incorporates momentum information and the Richardson-Lucy (RL) model into a lightweight neural network. ARLN emphasizes learning knowledge within the image domain and introduces an additive accelerated vector through minimal trainable convolution layers, which are integrated into the RL iterative scheme to accelerate convergence. Both simulations and real experiments demonstrate that, despite its simplicity, ARLN ensures interpretability and achieves comparable or even superior reconstruction performance, especially in small-sample scenarios. It reduces iterations by 6-10 × compared to the accelerated Richardson-Lucy (ARL) algorithm, achieves a greater reduction than 70% in computational cost and the number of parameters relative to lightweight networks, and reconstructs approximately 4-12 × faster than two representative model-driven networks. Owing to its lightweight design and accelerated deconvolution capability, ARLN has great potential and practical importance in restoring fast and resource-constrained fluorescence microscopy.",

  "title": "Deep-learning-enabled single-shot fringe projection profilometry based on inner shifting-phase encoding.",
  "abstract": "Single-shot fringe projection profilometry (FPP) offers significant advantages for dynamic three-dimensional (3D) measurement. However, existing deep learning-based single-shot methods still struggle to simultaneously and accurately extract the wrapped phase and fringe order. Because the former is a continuous physical quantity while the latter is a discrete integer label, their joint estimation from a single periodic pattern is inherently ambiguous, especially for isolated objects lacking spatial continuity. To address this problem, a deep learning-enabled single-shot FPP method is proposed by integrating inner shifting-phase encoding with a physically constrained dual-network architecture. The fringe order is embedded into the phase-shifting component of a single high-frequency fringe pattern, and two lightweight convolutional neural networks are then employed: one regresses the numerator and denominator of the wrapped phase, while the other classifies the inner shifting-phase value to recover the fringe order. This physically consistent decoupled design avoids the optimization conflicts of end-to-end regression and enables unambiguous absolute phase recovery. Experiments show that the proposed method could achieve high-accuracy absolute phase recovery comparable to traditional multi-frame techniques for measurements of complex and isolated objects, while maintaining low computational complexity. The dynamic experimental results demonstrate its application potential for dynamic 3D measurement.",

  "title": "SNR enhancement for low-SNR amplitude-modulated holographic data storage based on deep learning.",
  "abstract": "In amplitude-modulated holographic storage, due to material inhomogeneity, optical system aberrations, and environmental interference, the recorded and read amplitude data pages often contain a large amount of random noise, leading to a decrease in the image signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). However, the traditional U-Net has a limited ability to handle random noise, particularly for low-SNR data pages, making it difficult to effectively enhance SNR. This paper proposes an improved U-Net named DRAMCU-Net (dilated residual attention and multi-scale convolution U-Net) for enhancing the SNR of holographic data storage images. DRAMCU-Net achieves multi-level feature extraction and attention focusing by introducing dilated residual attention blocks (DRABs) and utilizing multi-scale convolutional blocks (MS-Conv) instead of traditional convolutional blocks to efficiently capture feature information at different scales. Additionally, a dropout layer is employed to enhance the model's global robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that compared to the U-Net, the low-SNR data pages reconstructed by DRAMCU-Net achieve approximately 30% higher SNR.",

  "title": "Encryption and decryption applications on conductive films using THz real-time high-resolution imaging.",
  "abstract": "In this work, we present a terahertz (THz) real-time quasi-near-field imaging system for low-cost and highly concealable information encryption and decryption. By exploiting the distinct THz transmission properties of graphite pencils with different compositions, we designed three types of encryption structures, including text, coating, and QR code patterns. All structures were successfully decrypted, demonstrating the feasibility of material-based THz encryption. However, the imaging clarity significantly deteriorates under ultra-low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions, which is a major challenge in practical applications. To address this issue, we propose a modified U-Net denoising method that integrates multi-frequency feature fusion and THz-specific physical priors. The network effectively suppresses noise while preserving fine structural details. Experimental results show that, compared with the conventional block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D) algorithm, our method achieves superior performance, with peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), structural similarity (SSIM), and feature similarity (FSIM) values significantly improved. More importantly, encrypted information remains clearly recognizable even in complex noise environments. This work combines material-based encryption strategies, advanced THz imaging, and deep learning denoising into a unified framework. Owing to its low implementation cost, strong concealment, and enhanced stability, the proposed approach offers a promising pathway for extending THz imaging to secure communication, anti-counterfeiting, and information protection.",

  "title": "Physics-prior and deep learning fusion for single-plane diffractive imaging in frequency-spatial domains.",
  "abstract": "Traditional optical systems often require multiple lenses and substantial physical space to achieve high imaging quality. In contrast, single-plane diffractive optical elements (SPDOEs) enable compact, single-element imaging due to their unique imaging characteristics. This paper proposes a prior-guided computational imaging method tailored for SPDOEs. Specifically, a prior-guided attention-enhanced multiscale deblurring network (PAMDN) was developed to achieve high-quality image reconstruction. An SPDOE with an easily manufacturable f-number of 5 and a focal length of 50 mm was designed and fabricated. A full field-of-view (FOV) average wavefront aberration model was established, and diffraction efficiency under fabrication errors was analyzed. Based on these, RGB-channel prior PSF features and loss-function weights were constructed. Frequency-domain features were extracted via inverse filtering of the degraded image and prior PSF. A multiscale attention mechanism then fuses both spatial- and frequency-domain features for final image reconstruction. A small-sample training dataset was established using real-world images captured by the fabricated SPDOE and a high-quality industrial lens. Experimental results show that PAMDN improves the average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) by 30% over conventional PSF-based deconvolution methods, with gains exceeding 13 dB across various FOV regions. This paper provides a theoretical foundation for high-quality imaging with SPDOEs and offers a new perspective for the miniaturization of future optical systems.",

  "abstract": "The photon-counting camera has single-photon sensitivity and picosecond time resolution, enabling the acquisition of beacons from thousands of kilometers away for deep-space optical sensing and communication. However, the accurate estimation of the beacon beam center is challenged by the random fluctuations of signal photons and the presence of randomly and widely distributed noise photons. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning-based super-resolution beam position estimator (DSRBPE), which improves the accuracy of beam position estimation through reasonable photon data modeling, as well as optimizing the design of the super-resolution convolutional neural network framework and loss function. Simulation and experimental results show that DSRBPE can achieve sub-pixel precision of 0.2 pixels for super-resolution centroid extraction of an extremely weak 4×4 pixel size Gaussian spot on a 32×32 single-photon array detector, and exhibits superior robustness under low signal-to-noise ratio conditions compared with conventional algorithms.",

  "abstract": "This paper proposes a latent-diffusion-model-based method to achieve temporal super-resolution in optical sound-field imaging. Optical sound-field imaging, known for its high spatial resolution, measures sound by detecting small variations in the refractive index of air caused by sound. Due to the extremely high speed of sound propagation, optical imaging systems require exceptionally high frame rates for sound-field measurement, which results in high power consumption as well as extremely time-consuming data transmission and processing during long-duration data acquisition. Therefore, to alleviate the sampling requirements of high-speed cameras, mitigate data transmission and processing demands, reduce imaging power consumption, and enhance the temporal quality of imaging, we propose a latent-diffusion-model-based method to achieve temporal super-resolution. During inference, the measured sound-field images are utilized as conditional constraints, enabling the model to generate intermediate sound-field frames between any two consecutive frames in the temporal sequence. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms other deep learning approaches in the temporal super-resolution task on optically measured sound-field data. The experimental results demonstrate the applicability of our model to the real world.",

  "abstract": "With the increasing demand for low-light color imaging technology in the fields of night vision photography, military surveillance, and assistive driving, the traditional Bayer array suffers from a narrow spectral range and insufficient light intake. To overcome these limitations, the RGBW array extends the Bayer array by capturing a broader spectral range, yet its unique structure introduces a complex demosaicking challenge. In this work, a demosaicking method based on residual interpolation prior and a dual-branch decoding network is proposed for RGBW imaging. A preprocessing interpolation algorithm transforms the demosaicking task into an image restoration problem better suited for deep learning networks. The dual-branch decoding network leverages the high sensitivity of the W channel to optimize the image reconstruction. Additionally, a low-light image acquisition system is developed, and a dataset is constructed from real-world low-light scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the RGBW demosaicking performance under low-light conditions, achieving reconstructed images with enhanced details and color fidelity closely matching the human visual perception.",

  "abstract": "This study tackles the spatial resolution limitations of traditional light field microscopy by proposing a 3D resolution enhancement method that integrates innovations in optical system design and deep learning-based reconstruction. A hybrid Fourier light field microscopy (HFLFM) system is developed to capture high-resolution central views and multi-angle low-resolution light field images simultaneously, achieving an incompatible balance between image quality and angular information acquisition. Based on this system, a resolution enhancement network is constructed, featuring three key modules: a self-attention angular enhancement module for modeling inter-view consistency and global dependencies, a hybrid residual feature extraction module for enhancing high-frequency detail recovery, and a progressive resolution enhancement fusion module for fine-grained reconstruction. This architecture effectively constructs the geometric relationships and spatial details, improving both angular consistency and image clarity. Experiments on the dense light field dataset (DLFD), the HCI 4D light field dataset, and our hybrid microscopic system demonstrate superior performance in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM), along with excellent 3D reconstruction accuracy. A lateral-resolution experiment verifies a fourfold improvement, and the max error in depth evaluation is reduced by approximately 88%, confirming the feasibility and precision, and of the proposed method and HFLFM system. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. In summary, the proposed method enhances the spatial resolution of light field microscopy through joint optimization of optical system innovation and associated network design for data processing, offering an effective and credible solution for high-quality 3D reconstruction without increasing system complexity.",

  "title": "Deep anomaly detection for active attacks on the receiver in quantum key distribution.",
  "abstract": "Traditional countermeasures against attacks targeting the receiver in quantum key distribution (QKD) systems often suffer from poor compatibility with deployed infrastructure, the risk of introducing new vulnerabilities, and limited applicability to specific types of active attacks. In this work, we propose an anomaly detection (AD) model based on one-class machine learning to address active attacks targeting the receiver. By constructing a dataset from the QKD system's operational states, the AD model learns the characteristics of normal behavior under secure conditions. When an active attack occurs, the system's state deviates from the learned normal patterns and is identified as anomalous by the model. Experimental results show that the AD model achieves an area under the curve (AUC) exceeding 99%, effectively safeguarding the receiver of the QKD system. Compared to traditional approaches, our model can be deployed with minimal cost in existing QKD networks without requiring additional optical or electrical components, thus avoiding the introduction of new side channels. Furthermore, unlike multi-class machine learning algorithms, our approach does not rely on prior knowledge of specific attack types and is potentially able to detect unknown active attacks. These advantages-generality, ease of deployment, low cost, and high accuracy-make our model a practical and effective tool for protecting the receiver of QKD systems against active attacks.",

  "title": "DLAO: a physics-informed deep learning framework for aberration correction in optical coherence tomography.",
  "abstract": "Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is an indispensable high-resolution, non-invasive imaging modality in biomedical diagnostics and research. Its performance, however, is frequently compromised by optical aberrations arising from system imperfections and sample-induced inhomogeneities, which degrade image quality by reducing spatial resolution and obscuring fine details. To address this challenge, we introduce a physics-informed deep learning adaptive optics (DLAO) framework for the efficient correction of complex aberrations in OCT images. The framework introduces a pseudo-point spread function (pseudo-PSF) preprocessing step, which reformulates the high-dimensional image restoration task into a low-dimensional physical parameter estimation problem. This is achieved by processing pairs of images captured with known bias aberrations, which effectively decouples sample-specific structural information from the aberration features at the input stage, thereby reducing data dimensionality and computational load. To decode these compact aberration features, we designed the layerwise adaptive progressive attention network (LAPANet), which integrates a multi-scale feature fusion mechanism with a novel LAPA module to enhance the capture of hierarchical, multi-scale features. This synergistic design enables the network to precisely reconstruct critical image regions, demonstrating exceptional performance in restoring high-frequency details and modeling complex aberration patterns. Experimental validation on tasks involving the correction of aberrations defined by Zernike coefficients demonstrates that our architecture outperforms several mainstream deep learning models by achieving higher peak signal-to-noise ratio and structural similarity index scores, while maintaining high inference efficiency. Furthermore, ablation studies and a series of generalization and extension experiments were conducted to validate the effectiveness, robustness, and generalization capability of the proposed architecture, confirming its efficacy and practical value in enhancing OCT image quality.",

  "title": "Efficient routing algorithm for trusted relay quantum key distribution networks via quantum reinforcement learning.",
  "abstract": "Trusted relay quantum key distribution networks (TR-QKDNs) have emerged as one of the most practical solutions for implementing large-scale QKDNs. The development of efficient routing algorithms is crucial to ensure adaptability to diverse network parameters and topologies. However, current approaches suffer from multiple limitations, including insufficient consideration of key influencing factors, excessive reliance on manually configured parameters, and scalability bottlenecks caused by the exponential complexity of classical algorithms. In this paper, we propose a quantum reinforcement learning-based routing algorithm, named hybrid quantum deep deterministic policy gradient (HQ-DDPG) that integrates a custom-designed quantum neural network (QNN) with the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), to intelligently balance multiple influencing factors and dynamically optimize routing decisions in TR-QKDNs. To reduce computational complexity, we further utilize a quantum single-source shortest path (QSSP) algorithm to compute the optimal routing path. Training results demonstrate that the proposed HQ-DDPG outperforms DDPG in terms of performance metrics, achieving nearly double the training convergence speed while reducing resource requirements by approximately 45 times and exhibiting superior network expressiveness. In typical network topology tests, the proposed algorithm consistently maintains a quantum key delivery ratio above 91.35% under high-load demand, significantly surpassing both DDPG and optimized link state routing (OLSR). Finally, leveraging distributed quantum computing, the proposed QNN enables efficient solutions for large-scale TR-QKDN problems with fewer quantum resources.",

  "title": "Light scattering patterns of triaxial ellipsoidal drops and their use in inferring drops' shapes, aided by deep learning.",
  "abstract": "Nonspherical liquid drops are commonly encountered in atmospheric optics, multiphase flows, and chemical engineering, where accurate determination of their shape and size is essential for both fundamental research and practical applications. However, resolving the true three-dimensional (3D) geometry of nonspherical drops remains a significant challenge for conventional measurement techniques, which typically rely on multi-view imaging. In contrast, a single light scattering pattern intrinsically encodes the geometrical features of a drop, offering a promising alternative for 3D shape inference. While prior studies have primarily addressed spheroidal drops with rotational symmetry, the scattering characteristics of more general nonspherical drops remain largely unexplored. In this work, we extend the vectorial complex ray model for 3D scattering (VCRM3D) to investigate the light scattering by triaxial ellipsoidal drops. The simulation results were validated against multilevel fast multipole algorithm (MLFMA) solutions over a broad range of axial ratios. Leveraging the efficiency of VCRM3D, we established and released the first database of light scattering patterns for ellipsoidal drops. As a proof of principle, we trained a convolutional neural network on this synthetic database to retrieve drop shape parameters, achieving mean relative errors below 1.5 on simulated scattering patterns. Compared to conventional methods that rely on costly and complex multi-view imaging, the proposed approach requires only a single light scattering pattern to reconstruct the drop's 3D shape. Beyond uncovering the light scattering characteristics of triaxial ellipsoidal drops, this work demonstrates a promising path toward advanced yet cost-effective optical diagnostics for nonspherical drops.",

  "title": "Charting a course for freshwater biomonitoring: The grand challenges identified by the global scientific community.",
  "abstract": "The past 50 years have seen biomonitoring emerge as an essential means of generating the knowledge needed to inform protection and restoration of freshwater ecosystems. Despite the successes of biomonitoring, most freshwater ecosystems remain unmonitored. Moreover, degradation of freshwaters continues at a rapid rate with new threats and novel stressors emerging that are difficult to assess using existing techniques. New technologies and techniques have been developed to improve biomonitoring, but application has been slow and integration with existing approaches is often problematic. Clearly, freshwater biomonitoring faces many important challenges that must be addressed to meet management needs of the coming decades. We identify Grand Challenges facing freshwater biomonitoring with the aim of encouraging research and practice to address these challenges. We asked 256 biomonitoring scientists from around the globe to identify what they considered the most important challenges. From their submissions we established five Grand Challenges and 18 associated subchallenges. For each Grand Challenge, we outline the current state of biomonitoring practice and suggest promising pathways and approaches to address them. By identifying and describing these challenges, we strive to position freshwater biomonitoring to take advantage of emerging opportunities and enhance its capacity to meet current and future management needs.",

  "title": "Personalized echocardiographic segmentation via bidirectional encoder representations from transformers Y-shaped network with patient attributes.",
  "abstract": "Accurate cardiac structure segmentation from echocardiography is essential for quantitative cardiac function assessment in clinical cardiology. However, traditional manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective, and existing automated methods often overlook inter-patient anatomical differences, particularly sex-related variability, limiting their generalizability. We propose BTY-Net (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) Text-based Y-shaped Network), a novel automatic segmentation framework designed to incorporate patient-specific attributes, enabling personalized and anatomically adaptive segmentation of echocardiograms. BTY-Net is built upon a Unet3+ backbone combined with a Transformer encoder, incorporates a multi-layer denoising filter to enhance image quality, and employs a pre-trained BERT model to encode patient demographic and acquisition context as natural language embeddings. Experiments were conducted on the Cardiac Acquisitions for Multi-structure Ultrasound segmentation dataset (500 biplane cases, 400/50/50 train/validation/test split). We benchmarked eight state-of-the-art models (e.g., variants of Unet and generative adversarial networks). Dice similarity (Dice) and Hausdorff Distance (HD) served as the primary metrics. Statistical significance was assessed via the Wilcoxon signed-rank test with p < 0.05 as the threshold, and Holm-Bonferroni correction (α = 0.05) was applied for multiple comparisons. The Hedges' g effect was calculated to quantify the difference. BTY-Net achieved the highest Dice coefficients across the three cardiac structures (LV endocardium: 0.9316 ± 0.027; LV myocardium: 0.8617 ± 0.050; left atrium: 0.8703 ± 0.086) and the lowest HD values (8.14 ± 3.44, 10.97 ± 7.41, and 11.13 ± 8.16, respectively). Compared with the strongest baseline, BTY-Net improved Dice by up to 0.02-0.03 and reduced HD by approximately 1.1-1.5 mm, with Holm-adjusted p < 0.05 and small-to-medium Hedges'g effect sizes. Across all test cases, BTY-Net yielded the highest agreement with reference ejection fraction (correlation = 0.9119, MAE = 3.40%). Sex-stratified analyses further confirmed stable performance in both male and female subgroups, indicating robust adaptation to anatomical diversity. BTY-Net offers an effective and interpretable solution for personalized echocardiographic analysis. By leveraging multimodal fusion of patient information and image data, it enhances segmentation accuracy, and embeds clinically meaningful attention maps, thereby delivering a multimodal, sex-robust and clinically interpretable solution for routine echocardiographic analysis.",

  "title": "Children's dental panoramic radiograph image segmentation via dual aggregation transformer UNet.",
  "abstract": "Medical image processing is a critical field in computer vision, aiding in diagnostics and advancing medical research. Specifically, the diagnosis of children's dental conditions often involves the use of panoramic radiographs, which necessitate the segmentation of teeth for accurate diagnosis. However, children's teeth present more complexities than adult teeth due to limited datasets and the substantial changes in size and shape with age, along with the transition period between deciduous and permanent teeth, making segmentation challenging. This paper aims to introduce a medical image segmentation model specifically designed for children's teeth datasets, capable of efficiently and accurately segmenting children's teeth. We designed a novel network structure called dual aggregation transformer UNet (DATUnet). The transformer layers aggregate features across spatial and channel dimensions, applying spatial and channel self-attention mechanisms alternately in transformer blocks. This enhances the ability to extract variable shapes and sizes from children's teeth and address the issues like indistinct images and blurriness. Additionally, we developed a multi-scale fusion decoder structure that adaptively fuses shallow and deep information processed through the transformer blocks. Our model, evaluated on a private dataset of children's dental panoramic radiographs, achieved outstanding performance with a pixel accuracy (PA) of 98.02%, Dice coefficient of 93.20%, and Hausdorff distance (HD) of 4.21. Compared to other methods, our proposed model achieves superior results, reaching the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in this field.",

  "abstract": "Vaccination can help control the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic but is undermined by vaccine hesitancy. Social media disseminates information and misinformation regarding vaccination. Tracking and analyzing social media vaccine sentiment could better prepare health professionals for vaccination conversations and campaigns. A real-time big data analytics framework was developed using natural language processing sentiment analysis, a form of artificial intelligence. The framework ingests, processes, and analyzes tweets for sentiment and content themes, such as natural health or personal freedom, in real time. A later dataset evaluated the relationship between Twitter sentiment scores and vaccination rates in the United States. The real-time analytics framework showed a widening gap in sentiment with more negative sentiment after vaccine rollout. After rollout, using a static dataset, an increase in positive sentiment was followed by an increase in vaccination. Lag cross-correlation analysis across US regions showed evidence that once all adults were eligible for vaccination, the sentiment score consistently correlated with vaccination rate with a lag of around 1 week. The Granger causality test further demonstrated that tweet sentiment scores may help predict vaccination rates. Social media has influenced the COVID-19 response through valuable information and misinformation and distrust. This tool was used to collect and analyze tweets at scale in real time to study sentiment and key terms of interest. Separate tweet analysis showed that vaccination rates tracked regionally with Twitter vaccine sentiment and might forecast changes in vaccine uptake and/or guide targeted social media and vaccination strategies. Further work is needed to analyze the interplay between specific populations, vaccine sentiment, and vaccination rates.",

  "title": "Morphological Data Analysis: From Descriptor Development to Predictive Modeling.",
  "abstract": "This chapter explores the computational processing of morphological fingerprints for downstream analysis, including compound similarity search and activity prediction. Morphological fingerprints, derived from cell painting assay images, are numerical vectors characterizing the spatial arrangement, morphology, and texture of organelles. Using these vectors, one can train machine learning (ML) models to identify patterns and predict changes in cell morphology upon compound treatment. The chapter consists of three sections, each supported by a Jupyter notebook. The first section covers data preparation for computational analysis, such as ingesting the data, standardization, removing missing values, and normalizing data. The second section details the computation of similarity searches, identifying the closest match to a query, e.g., to identify compounds with a similar mode of action. In addition, structural fingerprints, which are derived from the molecular structure itself, are introduced to perform complementary searches on different molecular fingerprints. The third section demonstrates how to build a basic ML model to predict estrogen receptor activity and provides insights into model tuning, testing, and interpretation. Overall, this chapter provides a comprehensive guide to leveraging morphological fingerprints for advanced computational analysis in drug discovery and activity prediction studies.",

  "abstract": "High-throughput/high-content multiplexed phenotypic (HTS/HCS) screens, such as Cell Painting PLUS (CPP), are employed to identify morphological changes in cells induced by chemical compound treatments or genetic perturbations. These phenotypic screens generate extensive imaging data, from which hundreds to thousands of features describing cellular morphology can be extracted. Open-source software, such as Cell Profiler and KNIME Analytics Platform, provides useful tools for image analysis and data processing.In this chapter, we present a comprehensive Cell Profiler pipeline for the analysis of images generated using the Cell Painting PLUS method. The image analysis procedure starts with illumination correction, followed by image registration using 4i stitcher software developed in our laboratory to combine images scanned from different staining cycles. Subsequently, cell region segmentation and feature extraction are performed. The approximately 3000 extracted features are processed via the KNIME Analytics Platform, which relies primarily on visual programming elements to minimize the need for coding expertise. This process includes normalization and benchmark dose modeling. The responsive features or feature categories are visualized using an \"accumulation plot\" and a \"magnitude plot,\" allowing users of CPP to summarize the most potentially affected organelle by the tested compound or genetic perturbation.",

  "abstract": "Chronic rejection remains a significant challenge in solid organ transplantation, contributing to graft dysfunction and eventual failure despite advances in immunosuppressive therapies. Computational modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for understanding chronic rejection mechanisms, enhancing diagnostic precision, and identifying novel therapeutic targets. This chapter explores various computational approaches, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, ordinary differential equations, partial differential equations, agent-based models, and gene network analysis applied to solid organ transplantation: kidney, liver, heart, and lung. While computational models offer numerous advantages, including cost-effectiveness and the ability to integrate multi-omics data, challenges remain in terms of data quality, standardization, and clinical validation. Bridging these gaps will require comprehensive longitudinal studies and the development of hybrid models that combine diverse computational techniques. Emerging technologies such as single-cell transcriptomics and spatial genomics hold promise for enhancing predictive accuracy and understanding cellular heterogeneity. As computational methods evolve, their integration with experimental research will be essential for developing precision medicine strategies to improve long-term graft survival.",

  "title": "Category learning in deep neural networks: Information content and geometry of internal representations.",
  "abstract": "In humans and other animals, category learning is associated with a better ability to discriminate between stimuli that are close to the category boundary, compared with stimuli well within a category. This perceptual within-category compression and between-category separation, called categorical perception, was also empirically observed in artificial neural networks trained on classification tasks. In previous modeling works based on empirical neuroscience data, we took an information-theoretic approach that shows that this expansion-compression is a necessary outcome of efficient learning. As a result, the impact of input or neuronal noise is reduced where it is most detrimental, namely, at the boundary between categories. Here we extend our theoretical framework to artificial feedforward networks. The Bayes cost that we consider is an average over the data distribution of the standard cross-entropy loss function. We show that minimizing this cost implies maximizing the mutual information between the set of categories and the neural activities prior to the decision layer. We then consider structured data, formalized by the assumption of an underlying feature space of small dimension. We show that, for wide networks, and more generally in situations of high signal-to-noise ratio, maximizing the mutual information implies (i) finding an appropriate projection space, and (ii) building a neural representation with the appropriate metric. The latter is based on a Fisher information matrix measuring the sensitivity of the neural activity to changes in the projection space. Optimal learning makes this neural Fisher information follow a category-specific Fisher information, measuring the sensitivity of the category membership to changes in the projection space. One consequence is that category learning induces the main neural correlate of categorical perception, an expansion of neural space near decision boundaries. To make this statement more precise, we characterize the properties of the categorical Fisher information. We show that its eigenvectors give the most discriminant directions at each point of the projection space. We find that, unexpectedly, its maxima are in general not exactly at, but near, the class boundaries. Considering toy models and the MNIST handwritten digits dataset, we numerically illustrate how, after learning, the two Fisher information matrices match and essentially align with the boundaries between categories. Finally, we provide a variety of supplemental analyses, in particular, we relate our approach to that of the information bottleneck, and we exhibit a bias-variance decomposition of the Bayes cost, which is of interest on its own.",

  "title": "Enhanced Diagnosis of Lung and Colon Cancer Severity Through Deep Feature Analysis Using DenseNet201 and SVM With Histopathological Images: A Super-Resolution Approach.",
  "abstract": "The worldwide healthcare system faces significant challenges due to the increasing prevalence of lung and colon cancer, highlighting the need for timely and accurate detection to improve patient prognosis. The precision of cancer diagnosis is highly dependent on the expertise of histopathologists, making it a complex and demanding endeavor. A shortage of sufficiently skilled experts can lead to the ineffective allocation of healthcare resources, potential misdiagnoses, and unwarranted interventions, ultimately threatening patient well-being. However, technological advancements have introduced deep learning as a powerful tool in clinical applications, particularly in the field of medical imaging. This study aims to develop a novel diagnostic method leveraging deep learning techniques to enhance the accuracy of lung and colon cancer detection. The study utilized the LC25000 dataset, which comprises 25 000 histopathological images of lung and colon tissue. A novel approach was implemented using a Fast Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network (FSRCNN) for image enhancement and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model based on DenseNet201 for classification. The FSRCNN was employed to improve the clarity and detail of images by increasing their resolution, which is crucial for accurate cancer detection. The proposed model demonstrated superior performance compared to existing Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models. It achieved an overall accuracy of 98.00%, precision of 98.10%, sensitivity of 98%, F1 score of 0.98, and specificity of 99.50%. These metrics indicate a significant enhancement in diagnostic accuracy and reliability, underscoring the effectiveness of the FSRCNN and SVM-based DenseNet201 model. The implementation of the FSRCNN and SVM-based DenseNet201 model provided substantial improvements in the detection of lung and colon cancer, as evidenced by high accuracy and specificity metrics. While the LC25000 dataset offered a solid foundation for this analysis, future research should aim to validate the model's effectiveness using a broader array of diverse and extensive datasets. Additionally, integrating supplementary diagnostic techniques, such as genetic data and electronic health records, could further enhance the model's diagnostic precision and practical application in cancer diagnosis.",

  "abstract": "To describe the distribution of ocular disorders in patients with a family history of consanguinity presenting to a multi-tier ophthalmology hospital network in India. This cross-sectional hospital-based study included 2,805,267 new patients presenting between August 2010 and April 2021. Patients with a family history of consanguinity were included as cases. The sociodemographic and clinical data were collected using an electronic medical record system. Overall, 20,445 (0.73%) new patients were documented to have a family history of consanguinity. The prevalence rates were 4.04% in children (age: <16 years) and 0.21% in adults. The mean age of the patients was 11.87 ± 11.06 years. The majority of the patients were males (56.48%) and students (54.43%) by profession. The majority (93.05%) of the patients were in the 0-30-years age bracket, with over half of them (53.71%) presenting in the first decade of life. A significant number of patients were from higher socioeconomic status (73.48%) and the rural region (47.62%). The most common degree of consanguinity documented was second degree (3.95%). The most common ocular disorders associated with a high proportion of consanguinity were congenital hereditary endothelial dystrophy (CHED) (100%), corneal macular dystrophy (83.78%), xeroderma pigmentosum (80.95%), and ocular albinism (73.59%). A tenth of the patients (9.8%) reported a similar history of ocular disorders among the family members and more commonly among the siblings (70.4%). Consanguineous marriages are not uncommon in India. They cause ocular disorders that cause visual impairment in a significant majority of those affected in their early decades of life. Genetic counseling plays a role in prevention.",

  "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being explored in radiology, including its potential role in emergency imaging settings. However, global perspectives on AI adoption, usefulness, and limitations among emergency radiologists remain underexplored. To assess awareness, usage, perceived benefits, and limitations of AI tools among radiologists practicing emergency radiology worldwide. A 16-question survey was distributed globally between October 24, 2024, and August 4, 2025, targeting radiologists working in academic, community, and private settings who practice emergency radiology as a primary or secondary subspecialty. The survey was disseminated direct emails extracted using automated and manual methods from recent publications in major radiology journals. A total of 57 responses were collected. AI awareness was high (93%), but frequent clinical use was reported by only 28%. Daily use of AI in emergent imaging was limited to 23% of respondents. The majority anticipated AI becoming essential within five years (68%), and 51% believed AI would replace certain radiological tasks. Image interpretation and acquisition were the most common AI applications. Key perceived benefits included improved diagnostic accuracy and increased efficiency, while concerns included limited accuracy, integration difficulties, and cost. Trust in AI varied by experience, with less experienced radiologists viewed as more trusting. While emergency radiologists globally recognize AI's potential, significant barriers to its routine adoption remain. Addressing issues of trust, cost, accuracy, and workflow integration is essential to unlock AI's full utility in emergency radiology.",

  "abstract": "This study explores the potential of nursing records in improving pharmaceutical safety by analyzing adverse effects (AEs) using ChatGPT-4 for data categorization. A total of 927 anonymized records from a Japanese community hospital were analyzed through a three-stage protocol: identifying AEs using ChatGPT-4, constructing a co-occurrence network to analyze relationships among key terms, and identifying central patterns using network metrics. Results revealed a high proportion of entries classified as \"Unknown\" for both AE status (674 cases) and patient conditions (865 cases), highlighting documentation gaps. The most frequently documented medicines were Red Blood Cells (123 instances) and Fresh Frozen Plasma (87 instances), while Thermal Therapy (30 instances) and CT Scans (23 instances) were the most used medical devices. However, AE documentation was limited, with only 6 cases for medicines and 2 for devices. The co-occurrence network emphasized the importance of informed consent (IC) in communicating treatment risks, particularly in chemotherapy and antibiotic use. Despite challenges, this study underscores the critical role of nursing records in AE management and calls for standardized documentation and integration. Future efforts could explore combining large language models with human-in-the-loop feedback to further improve AE extraction accuracy from incomplete nursing notes. into clinical workflows to enhance patient safety.",

  "abstract": "The curation of precision oncology knowledge bases requires intensive screening of scientific literature. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer potential to assist with knowledge extraction and curation through automated abstract screening, though their utility in this context remains unexplored. We developed a decision tree-based pipeline utilising LLMs to automate literature screening for precision oncology knowledge bases. The system employs structured prompts to evaluate biomarker-therapeutic relationships across 8,012 abstracts from 25 oncology journals published in 2024. Performance was assessed against expert review using standard evaluation metrics; the pipeline achieved an overall accuracy of 92.9% (sensitivity [recall] 87.1%, specificity 93.7%) in shortlisting 1,328 candidate abstracts, of which 888 are considered relevant by experts, delivering a 5.26-fold enrichment in classification precision. Analysis of correctly identified abstracts revealed comprehensive coverage of key molecular targets, drug classes (immunotherapies and targeted therapies), and relevant cancer types. This pipeline automates literature triage for precision oncology knowledge bases for relevance, maintaining high specificity and potentially reducing manual screening burden whilst offering a scalable framework for sustainable knowledge base maintenance.",

  "abstract": "Frailty represents a particularly challenging aspect of population aging. While international guidelines advocate routine identification to enable evidence-based interventions, existing instruments often demand additional resources, limiting their practical implementation. Electronic tools facilitate the analysis of larger patient populations in less time, optimizing both resources and secondary data utilization. This project aimed to identify frailty using data from electronic medical records in diabetic patients aged 65 years and older. The Electronic Screening Index of Frailty (e-SIF), developed by Serra-Prat et al., was used in this study. This report outlines lessons learned from our experience and the processes involved in implementing this frailty detection tool.",

  "abstract": "Real-world data (RWD) obtained from electronic medical records has become a valuable resource for healthcare research. However, integrating unstructured free-text clinical data remains a significant challenge. Although natural language processing (NLP) offers a promising solution, its implementation is frequently hampered by high computational costs. Moreover, privacy concerns complicate data integration in multi-site RWD studies. This study proposes a hybrid platform that integrates centralized NLP processing with robust privacy protection, facilitating effective information extraction from free-text data across various institutions. We performed comparative experiments utilizing 500 sample reports to assess the efficacy of the proposed hybrid platform against a fully distributed method using on-site servers. The results indicated that the central graphics processing units server significantly outperformed the site central processing units, processing reports in 0.12 s compared to an average of 64.23 s. Additionally, the central server exhibited a low and consistent increase in processing time regardless of report lengths, highlighting its efficiency and scalability. Our developed hybrid platform enhances computational efficiency while tackling privacy and data governance issues.",

Prompt engineering was used to initially create a labeled dataset, which was then confirmed by human annotators. The performance of prompt-engineered models, fine-tuned models, and a rule-based approach was compared. The fine-tuned Llama 3 billion parameter model outperformed other models in its accuracy of extracting vaccine names. Model quantization enabled efficient deployment in resource-constrained environments.

  "abstract": "Extracting structured information from unstructured clinical text remains a critical challenge in healthcare. This study introduces a robust framework for clinical assertion detection, integrating domain-specific embeddings like BioBERT, contextualized learning, and a performance-driven voting mechanism. By leveraging pre-trained models, including BiLSTM-CNN-Char architectures, the framework effectively classifies clinical assertions across diverse dimensions, such as Polarity, Subject, and Tense. The result demonstrates high F1-scores (0.95-0.98) across key categories, highlighting its adaptability to complex clinical contexts. The framework outperforms existing approaches by addressing the challenges of nested concepts, small datasets, and imbalanced data. By incorporating multiple models and consolidating outputs through voting, the framework also reduces dependency on any single model, enhancing reliability and adaptability. These findings emphasize its potential for enhancing clinical decision-making, improving patient care, and supporting scalable healthcare research initiatives.",

  "abstract": "This study explores the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in extracting and structuring allergic reaction data from non-English clinical free texts. Leveraging open-source models such as Llama 3.1, Qwen 2.5, and Mistral NeMo, the study utilizes 500 anonymized German discharge letters from the University Hospital Schleswig-Holstein to test an end-to-end workflow. The presented approach extracts allergy information, maps it to SNOMED CT codes, and formats it into HL7 FHIR-compliant resources. Results demonstrate high accuracy in substance detection and encoding, although encoding errors occur due to complex string-matching problems. Reaction identification proves challenging, with mixed performance across models. The study highlights the potential for further improvements through model training on specific terminologies and enhanced prompt engineering. Overall, this proof-of-concept shows the promise of LLMs for varied, domain-specific healthcare tasks, enabling automation and scalability in handling complex clinical data.",

The framework encodes entity and relational information within clinical note segments, enabling LLMs to generate diverse and contextually accurate augmentations while preserving structural integrity. Augmented data is used to train a segmentation-based BERT model, overcoming sequence length limitations and integrating global context via BiLSTM.

  "title": "Beyond GPT-NER: ChatGPT as Ensemble Arbitrator for Discontinuous Named Entity Recognition in Health Corpora.",
  "abstract": "In medicine and healthcare, NER (Named Entity Recognition) involves identifying clinically relevant entities such as medications, symptoms, and adverse drug events (ADEs). This task is particularly challenging due to discontinuous NER (DNER), fragmented entities that may span multiple sentences. To date, methods to address DNER have not been explored using ensemble learning to the best of our knowledge. The advent of large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT has demonstrated significant potential across various NLP tasks. However, most studies use ChatGPT as a problem-solving tool, such as the well-known GPT-NER, rather than integrating it into ensemble learning. This paper proposes a novel ensemble method incorporating ChatGPT as an arbitrator to ensemble five state-of-the-art (SOTA) NER models through custom prompt engineering. An experiment conducted over three benchmark medical datasets, CADEC, ShARe13, and ShARe14, indicates that our proposed ChatGPT-coordinate ensemble outperformed SOTA models, achieving F1-score improvements of 1.13%, 0.54%, and 0.67% on the CADEC, ShARe13, and ShARe14 datasets, respectively. Compared to the voting ensemble, our method improved scores by 0.63%, 0.32%, and 0.09%, while achieving average F1-score gains of 7.42%, 0.89%, and 0.54% over GPT-3.5 and GPT-4.",

We implement in-context learning, demonstration selection, and fine-tuning with QLoRA. Results show Mistral-7B excels in few-shot settings, and Fine-tuning with F1 = 86%. These approaches safeguard data privacy and offer resource-efficient solutions for healthcare organizations. Our pipeline enables real-time ADR monitoring, helping clinicians address concerns more swiftly and enhance patient outcomes. Findings underscore that smaller LLMs can be effectively used under strict data privacy constraints, allowing healthcare teams to quickly identify and address patient-reported ADRs.

  "abstract": "The misuse of over-the-counter (OTC) drugs poses a significant global public health challenge. This study proposes a system for detecting and visualizing inappropriate OTC drug use in social media data. We constructed a corpus of 20,036 labeled Japanese tweets, including 7,000 medication-related posts, to address the linguistic and cultural nuances. By fine-tuning the Japanese bidirectional encoder representations from transformers models, the system identified misuse patterns such as overuse. The system also incorporates a visualization tool to illustrate temporal and categorical trends, aiding public health authorities in real-time pharmacovigilance efforts. The system demonstrated a strong performance in detecting specific misuse patterns and has the potential to provide insights through the visualization of temporal and categorical trends. Error analysis revealed challenges such as ambiguous terms and noise inherent in social media data. The model performed well with sufficient data, but struggled with underrepresented categories. Challenges with ambiguous terms and indirect references emphasize the need for improved contextual understanding and the potential benefits of larger language models or data augmentation techniques. Although this study focused on the Japanese context, the system identified OTC drug misuse patterns and provided information through visualization. This holds promise for real-time pharmacovigilance and can be applied to other languages, contributing to global efforts to monitor and mitigate drug misuse trends.",

  "abstract": "Phenotype definitions are crucial for the progression of precision and personalized medicine. Although phenotype knowledge bases such as PheKB and the OHDSI library are available, they rely heavily on manual input. This study introduces PheCatcher, an automated pipeline that integrates BiomedBERT-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) and Relation Extraction (RE) to extract phenotypes and standardized codes from biomedical literature. To complement human annotation, GPT-4 was utilized to generate synthetic data, which improved model performance. The NER model's F1 score for \"phenotype\" entities increased from 0.616 to 0.800, and the RE model achieved an F1 score of 0.901. The application of the pipeline to the PubMed Central (PMC) articles resulted in the extraction of 173,283 phenotype definitions, which are now publicly accessible. Our study underscores the potential of synthetic data for information extraction (IE) and offers the first evidence of the feasibility of leveraging synthetic data to build a complete IE system.",

A specialized machine learning model identified known AEs from anticancer agents like capecitabine, oxaliplatin, and anthracyclines, revealing a significantly higher incidence in the treatment groups compared to non-users. While the NLP approach effectively detected most symptomatic AEs requiring manual review, it struggled with rarely documented conditions and commonly used clinical terms. Overall, the method shows promise for automated AE detection in medical records, particularly for symptoms without laboratory markers or diagnosis codes.",

  "title": "Optimizing Nursing Records: Exploring the Impact of AI-Enhanced Documentation.",
  "abstract": "The standardization of medical records through structured templates has gained importance in improving the quality and safety of patient care. The results showed that missing rates ranged from 40.0% (fever reduction) to 43.9% (pain), while redundant entries ranged from 11.7% (mild fever) to 20.0% (fever). Analysis of medication mentions revealed reliance on general classifications, such as \"analgesics\" (0.43%) and \"antipyretics\" (0.35%), over specific drugs like acetaminophen (0.44%) or bisacodyl (0.51%). Free-form documentation led to inefficiencies and ambiguities, whereas structured templates improved specificity, particularly for medications critical to patient safety. The findings highlight the need for user-friendly templates to reduce variability and enhance the completeness of nursing records. Structured templates can streamline documentation, reduce redundancy, and improve the quality of care by prompting detailed and accurate entries. Additionally, integrating advanced technologies like AI could further optimize adherence to templates, ensuring consistent and safe clinical practices. A deeper exploration of user experience and organizational factors is warranted in future studies to enhance implementation success. AI-based tools, such as intelligent assistants that prompt missing entries in real time, could further enhance template adherence and improve data completeness. This study analyzed 90,432 anonymized nursing records to evaluate adherence to predefined documentation templates across five key topics: mild fever, pain, fever, bowel control, and fever reduction. Text mining techniques identified missing items, redundant entries, and medication mentions.",

The dataset comprising notes of patients with genitourinary conditions was manually annotated to compare the S&S extraction results with outputs generated by LLMs. We assessed three versions of the Llama model-Llama 3.1-13B, Llama 3.3-70B, and Me-Llama-13B-focusing on their consistency, runtime, and performance. Each model was tested on two tasks: (1) S&S extraction and (2) ICD-10 code generation. Our findings indicate that Llama 3.3-70B performed the best overall. With fast runtime and high consistency, it achieved an average recall of 0.87 and an average precision of 0.71 for S&S extraction, as well as an average recall of 0.71 and an average precision of 0.54 for ICD-10 code generation.",

  "abstract": "Older people in residential aged care facilities (RACFs) visit hospitals and utilise healthcare services more often than others in the community. Trends in hospitalization rates are essential for designing targeted aged care interventions to reduce preventable hospitalizations and optimize resource use. Unstructured free-text nursing notes in Australian RACFs provide updated health information but require significant manual annotation due to their lack of standardization for supervised learning applications. This manual process presents a significant barrier to efficient data mining and insight generation. To address these challenges, we developed a classification model leveraging a large language model (LLM) with few-shot prompting to identify hospitalisation records within unstructured nursing notes. We analysed six weeks of data for 970 residents; the balanced dataset includes 75 hospitalizations. The model achieved an accuracy of 92.4%, a recall of 92.0%, a precision of 79.3%, and an F1 score of 85.2%. Future research will focus on enhancing the model's performance and expanding its capability to extract additional insights, such as the reasons, times, and dates of hospitalisation. These advancements aim to provide a more comprehensive understanding of hospitalisation patterns and support the development of more effective aged care services.",

  "abstract": "Incident reports provide a rich source for analysing safety risks in healthcare systems. To support the timely analysis and interpretation of incident reports, natural language processing (NLP) can be applied. The aim of this paper is to evaluate the potential of large language models (LLMs) in extracting the causes of incidents and identifying contributing factors from incident reports. As dataset, we considered 10,063 messages from CIRRNET®, the Swiss national database for critical incidents in healthcare. We applied the LLM Gemma-2 to extract events, causes and contributing factors and group them along themes. 100 event reports were assessed manually regarding quality of extraction. Events were extracted with 92% accuracy, causes with 84% and contributing factors with 72% accuracy. Extraction of contributing factors fails as the LLM hallucinates or interprets. We conclude that LLMs show potential in analysing incident reports and can improve the efficiency and consistency of incident analysis.",

  "abstract": "Colon metabolomes associated with high-fat (H) versus energy-restricted (E) diets in early colorectal cancer (CRC) models have never been directly compared. The objectives of this study are to elucidate metabolites associated with diet, aberrant crypt foci (ACF), and diet:ACF interaction, using a lifetime murine model. Three-week-old mice consumed control (C), E, or H initiation diets for 18 weeks. ACF formation is initiated weeks 16-21 with azoxymethane injections, followed by progression diet crossover (to C, E, or H) through week 60. Colon extracts are analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS). Metabolites associated with diet, ACF, or diet:ACF are determined using regression models (FDR-adjusted p-value &lt;0.05). No metabolites are significantly associated with initiation diets, but concentrations of acylcarnitines and phospholipids are associated with C, E, and H progression diets. Purines, taurine, and phospholipids are associated with ACF presence. No significant associations between metabolites and diet:ACF interaction are observed. These results suggest that recent, rather than early-life, diet is more closely associated with the colon metabolome, particularly lipid metabolism. Results from this study also provide candidate biomarkers of early CRC development and provide support for the importance of early diet on influencing pre-CRC risk.",

  "abstract": "Machine learning is a powerful approach for analysing RNA sequences, particularly for understanding the function and regulation of noncoding RNAs. A critical step in this process is feature extraction, which transforms biological sequences into numerical representations that allow computational models to capture and interpret complex biological patterns. Despite its central role, the field of RNA feature extraction remains broad and fragmented, with limited standardization and accessibility hindering consistent application. In this comprehensive review, we address the fragmentation of the field by systematically organizing over 25 feature extraction strategies into sequence- and structure-based approaches. We further conduct a comparative analysis highlighting how the choice of feature sets impacts model performance, reinforcing the importance of integrated feature engineering. To facilitate practical adoption, it also provides a curated list of publicly available tools and software packages. By consolidating methodologies and resources, this work seeks to improve reproducibility, scalability, and interpretability in machine learning-driven RNA research.",

  "abstract": "Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is a serious autoimmune skin disease affecting older people. Given the highly prevalent polypharmacy in older people, identifying drug combinations associated with high BP risk is needed. To identify drug combinations frequently prescribed for older people prior to BP using association rule mining (ARM) and to estimate their risk of developing BP. We conducted a nested case-control study using UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink primary care records (1998-2021). ARM was used to identify the 10 most common drug class or active substance pairs most likely coprescribed (lift) on the same day and within 30 days of one another (sensitivity analysis). Fold change (FC; case-to-control lift ratio) was used to identify combinations with greater lift in cases. Multivariable conditional logistic regression was performed to estimate BP risk following combinations and their constituent drugs. Among 16 844 cases and 79 493 controls, the most frequent drug class combinations associated with increased BP risk with greater lift in cases were angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs)-statins (FC 1.31; FC in sensitivity analysis 1.18), antiplatelets-statins (1.23; 1.11), proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)-antiplatelets (1.22; 1.14), PPIs-statins (1.22; 1.14) and ACEIs-antiplatelets (1.20; 1.09). Substance combinations with a greater lift in cases included ramipril-simvastatin (FC 1.30), simvastatin-aspirin (1.21), ramipril-aspirin (1.19) and bendroflumethiazide-aspirin (1.16). The results of sensitivity analyses for substances were similar. BP risk following drug combinations was lower than after single drugs. Using ARM we found that the most frequently prescribed drug combinations associated with increased BP risk were used to treat cardiovascular diseases and hypertension. Patients should be vigilant for skin changes following these drugs rather than avoid them.",

This essay will explore the thesis that data-intensive research indeed constitutes a form of post-experimental research by interrogating research practices in precision medicine. Section 1 will introduce this thesis and highlight salient features of precision medicine as an example of post-experimental research. Section 2 suggests approach as a category that is broader than experimental system, as discussed by Rheinberger, and can serve to analyze and compare diverse forms of research, including experimental and post-experimental practices. The essay concludes with a reflection on how categories developed for the historiography of recent science might require an update when the science or its context changes (section 3).",

  "abstract": "Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) complicated by cardiogenic shock has high mortality and remains challenging even in the revascularization era. We conducted this study to understand patients' outcomes. We retrospectively analyzed electronic medical records data from 1175 patients with AMI complicated by cardiogenic shock that developed within 3 days of admission to a multicenter medical care system between January 1, 2000, and July 31, 2018. Patients with AMI were classified into the ST-segment elevation MI (STEMI) group or the non-ST-segment elevation MI (NSTEMI) group. The short-term and 1-year mortality and adverse events after index admission were analyzed via logistic regression and a Cox proportional hazards model. When compared with NSTEMI, patients with STEMI tended to be younger (65.68 ± 14.05 years vs 70.70 ± 12.99 years, P < .001), men (73.29% vs 60.87%, P < .001), and have fewer underlying chronic diseases. Short-term mortality at index hospitalization was 14.83% in the STEMI group and 21.30% in the NSTEMI group; long-term mortality was 17.06% for the STEMI group and 24.13% for the NSTEMI group. No difference was observed between the 2 groups for patients who developed a cerebral vascular accident during the admission period. However, the major and gastrointestinal bleeding rates were higher in the STEMI group (2.66% vs 0.22%, P = .014; 3.36% vs 0.22%, P = .007, respectively). Age and respiratory failure were the most significant risk factors for short-term mortality. Revascularization may be beneficial for the short-term outcome but did not reach significance in multivariable analysis. In patients with AMI with cardiogenic shock, NSTEMI was associated with a significantly higher mortality rate in short-term results.",

  "title": "Bi-Encoder-Based Approach to Biomedical Document-Level Entity Recognition and Relation Extraction.",
  "abstract": "Large-scale biomedical entity recognition and relation extraction are essential foundational tasks for downstream text mining tasks and applications, such as knowledge graph construction. Because many relations span sentence boundaries, document-level entity recognition and relation extraction is closely aligned with real-world demands. However, identifying complex and diverse entities and relations within a limited timeframe is challenging. Therefore, we propose an end-to-end approach called BioECR for biomedical document-level named entity recognition, coreference resolution, and relation extraction. This approach utilizes a bi-encoder structure combined with biomedical entity types and descriptions to solve nested biomedical entities in linear time, thereby enhancing the ability to recognise complex entities and relations. Then a composition graph convolutional neural network was proposed to address the noise in conventional graph convolutional networks, thereby reducing time overhead and selectively fusing multiple entities or contextual information. Finally, by combining entity type clustering methods, the problem of coreference errors among multiple types of entities is solved easily and quickly. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on all subtasks across three biomedical document-level datasets called CDR, GDA, and BioRED, and our approach reduces the inference time by approximately 60%.",

  "title": "Knowledge-Aware Synergistic Discovery of Drug Combinations: A Large Language Model Perspective.",
  "abstract": "Drug combination therapy with significant advantages is a well-established concept in cancer treatment. Some related efforts have been made with multiple artful deep learning techniques. However, they are usually based on data for drug synergy prediction, ignoring the professional characteristics of data and the systematic knowledge accumulation. Meanwhile, integrating the dispersed professional knowledge and effectively utilizing it in data remains a crucial technical challenge. In this study, we propose KSDDC, a novel model for knowledge-aware synergistic discovery of drug combinations from a large language model (LLM) perspective (i.e., from the continuously learnable and refined large database). Within this framework, three main modules are well-designed, i.e., knowledge-aware drug feature auto-encoding, knowledge-aware cell line feature encoding and drug-drug synergy prediction. Informative embeddings of samples are discovered and combined to make accurate drug synergy prediction. Overall, KSDDC is superior compared with the other shallow machine learning based methods and deep learning based methods on several synergistic prediction benchmarks, where about 19% F1-score improvements over the second best method on DrugComb_1 can be observed. Starting with drug synergy prediction, our studies with knowledge-enabled data mining offer valuable insights and serve as a reference method for future research in this field.",

  "abstract": "Deep learning applications may assist in automatically detecting coronary arteries on invasive coronary angiography (ICA). The authors aimed to train deep learning models for the segmentation of coronary arteries and the detection of significant stenoses on ICA, conduct external validation, and compare the performance with expert variabilities. ICA studies from Amsterdam University Medical Centers (center 1) and Emory University Hospital (center 2) were retrospectively collected. Contours of the main coronary arteries and their ≥50% stenoses were manually segmented using dedicated software. Deep learning-based models were created using data from center 1, center 2, and both centers. The performance of the models was assessed on unseen data and compared to expert variability. A total of 10,573 ICA images were used to train models: 9,065 from center 1 (n = 2,624) and 1,508 (n = 456) from center 2. Validation was done on 186 center 1 images and 123 center 2 images. The segmentation model trained on data sets from both centers had the highest median Dice coefficient (0.86; IQR: 0.81-0.88). The stenoses detection algorithm trained on both centers achieved a detection rate of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.63-0.71), similar to expert agreement (0.65; 95% CI: 0.63-0.68). The model trained on the data with the most stenoses yielded the highest stenosis detection rate (0.67; 95% CI: 0.64-0.71). When matched for data set size and proportion of stenoses, the models trained on both centers performed similarly. The models achieved performance levels on par with experts in coronary artery segmentation and detection of significant stenoses in the main arteries.",

  "title": "Traditional Chinese Medicinal Herbs for Treating Post-Ischemic Stroke Cognitive Impairment Insights From Frequency and Association Analysis.",
  "abstract": "This study analyzes medicinal herbs in Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) formulations for post-ischemic stroke cognitive impairment, identifying key herbs, their interactions, and potential therapeutic mechanisms through systematic review, frequency analysis, and association rule mining. Systematic searches were performed across major databases (CBM, CNKI, VIP, Wanfang Data) to find studies on TCM for post-ischemic stroke cognitive impairment. Inclusion criteria focused on studies reporting TCM formulas and their cognitive effects. Data extraction standardized herb names, and frequency analysis identified high-frequency herbs (>10%). Association rule mining was done using Python with a minimum support of 10%, a minimum confidence of 50%, and a maximum antecedent size of 5 to uncover key herb associations for therapeutic insights. A systematic review identified 56 studies on TCM formulas for post-ischemic stroke cognitive impairment, extracting 114 herbs. Frequency analysis found 27 herbs used in over 10% of formulas, with Ligusticum chuanxiong, Acorus tatarinowii, and Salvia miltiorrhiza being most common. Association rule mining revealed key combinations, suggesting potential synergistic effects in TCM treatments. This study highlights key traditional Chinese herbs and herb combinations commonly used in clinical practice for cognitive impairment after ischemic stroke. The findings suggest that herb pairs such as Ligusticum chuanxiong-Salvia miltiorrhiza and Acorus tatarinowii-Polygala tenuifolia may exert synergistic effects consistent with both TCM theory and modern pharmacology. These results provide direction for future targeted studies and support the rational formulation of TCM-based interventions in stroke rehabilitation.",

  "title": "Deep Learning in Modeling Tools for Structural Insights into Protein-RNA Complexes, Bridging Computational and Spectroscopic Approaches.",
  "abstract": "The structural characterization of protein-RNA complexes remains a major challenge in molecular biology, owing to the imbalance between the enormous number of known sequences and the limited set of experimentally determined structures. While sequence repositories now hold hundreds of millions of entries, the Protein Data Bank contains only ~250,000 resolved structures, with fewer than 7000 involving protein-RNA assemblies. Deep learning approaches have emerged as powerful solutions to bridge this gap. In particular, AlphaFold3 now enables modeling of proteins, nucleic acids, and their complexes, reaching unprecedented accuracy. Beyond its computational strengths, AlphaFold3 is transforming the way spectroscopic techniques are applied in structural biology. Indeed such spectroscopic methods greatly benefit from accurate in silico models, which provide essential frameworks to guide experimental design, interpret ambiguous data, and refine structural ensembles. Conversely, spectroscopic data can validate and improve computational predictions, creating a powerful synergy between AI-based modeling and experimental spectroscopy. In this chapter, we describe the principles and workflow of AlphaFold3 and illustrate its integration with spectroscopic methods. We also highlight current limitations, including reduced accuracy for long or flexible RNAs, insufficient representation of diverse RNA families in training datasets, and the static nature of predictions that overlook conformational heterogeneity. Looking forward, the combination of expanding structural databases, methodological advances in spectroscopy, and continuous refinement of deep learning models promises to further accelerate structural insights.",

  "abstract": "The genus Cystobacter has been reported to produce bioactive secondary metabolites and harbor abundant biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). However, its genomic and metabolomic potential remains largely unexplored due to the lack of systematic data mining studies. Here, we present the first paired genomic and metabolomic analysis of Cystobacter to uncover its secondary metabolic capabilities. By examining its genomic features and classifying BGC patterns, we provided a comprehensive overview of the biosynthetic capabilities of Cystobacter. Our analysis revealed that 91% of BGCs remain uncharacterized, with ribosomally synthesized and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) being the most predominant class. An in-depth analysis of RiPP core peptides from Cystobacter demonstrated distinct features compared to those from other species, and deep learning models predicted that five of these peptides have antimicrobial potential. As a proof of concept, we integrated the genomic data of Cystobacter ferrugineus Cbfe23 with its metabolomics profile, leading to the correlation of a cluster of novel tubulysin analogs with its biosynthetic pathway. This paired genomic and metabolomic analysis reveals the untapped secondary metabolic potential of Cystobacter, highlighting its important roles in drug discovery, microbial communities, and bioengineering.",

  "abstract": "Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) implies high morbidity and mortality. The assessment of covert HE (CHE) [i.e. minimal HE (MHE) plus grade 1 HE] is often neglected in Taiwan. Therefore, the aim was to investigate the potential of the animal naming test (ANT and simplified ANT (S-ANT) for assessing CHE in Chinese-speaking regions, specifically Taiwan. A prospective cohort study was conducted, comprising 65 cirrhotic patients and 29 healthy controls (relatives of the patients). Patients were followed up every three months and censored after two years or until death. Hospitalization for overt HE (OHE) and mortality were considered. All subjects underwent ANT, psychometric HE score (PHES), and mini-mental state examination (MMSE). The patients underwent an electroencephalogram (EEG) to detect slowing indicative of MHE. Cut-off values for ANT and S-ANT were assessed by ROC analysis and Youden's index, considering CHE as a reference. The prognostic values for OHE and OHE-free survival were assessed. Preliminary analysis confirmed that PHES ≤-4 is a good discriminant point for abnormal results. CHE was found in 29 patients: 9 had MHE (PHES ≤ -4 or altered EEG) and 20 had grade 1 HE. ANT and S-ANT were found to have diagnostic values for CHE: AUC = 0.807, 0.786; cut off: 18 and 19, respectively. ANT and S-ANT were found to have prognostic value for OHE, number of hospitalization episodes for OHE, and OHE recurrence-free survival. ANT shows promise as a tool for CHE detection, quantification, and follow-up in Taiwan and other Chinese-speaking regions.Key messagesThe animal naming test (ANT) is a simple and valid semantic fluency test that can be easily performed in outpatient or bedside settings in one minute and can also be used as a tool for covert hepatic encephalopathy (CHE) detection, quantification, and follow-up in Taiwan, other Chinese-speaking regions, and many other countries.The diagnostic value of ANT and S-ANT for CHE were found to be significant, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values of 0.807 and 0.786 respectively, and cut-off scores of 18 and 19.ANT and S-ANT have prognostic value for the first breakthrough of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE), number of hospitalization episodes for OHE, and OHE recurrence-free survival, independent of the MELD score.",

  "abstract": "This study aims to identify key factors influencing digital literacy among the elderly individuals in South Korea using advanced machine learning techniques, focusing on enhancing their quality of life and social participation. Data from the 2018 to 2019 National Survey of Older Koreans were utilized, encompassing responses from 9185 individuals aged 65 and above. Digital literacy was assessed through the ability to use various digital devices and applications. Predictors included demographic, socioeconomic, health, and social support variables. CatBoost, a gradient boosting algorithm, was employed for feature selection and importance ranking, followed by logistic regression analysis to determine the relationships between these predictors and digital literacy levels. The analysis revealed that higher education levels, employment status, economic status, social participation, subjective health, and informal support positively influenced digital literacy among the elderly individuals. Conversely, age and depression were negatively associated with digital literacy. The CatBoost model demonstrated superior performance in identifying significant predictors, with education level emerging as the most influential factor, followed by age and employment status. The findings highlight the multifaceted nature of digital literacy among the elderly individuals, emphasizing the importance of educational attainment, social engagement, and economic conditions. Targeted interventions addressing these factors can effectively bridge the digital divide, ensuring that the elderly population can fully participate in the digital age and enhance their overall well-being.",

  "abstract": "According to current research, the main components of Duhuo, such as volatile oils and coumarins, possess anti-inflammatory and antitumor properties. However, the precise mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate the potential mechanisms of Duhuo in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using network pharmacology. The TCMSP, GeneCards, and DisGeNET databases were used to identify the active ingredients and target genes of Duhuo, as well as the RA-related genes. Common targets were determined using a Venn diagram. Cytoscape software was employed to construct protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks, and the core targets were identified and analyzed. Gene ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analyses were performed using the DAVID database to visualize functional pathways. A total of nine active compounds in Duhuo, 274 potential target genes, and 96 overlapping genes associated with both Duhuo and RA were identified. PPI network analysis revealed SRC, EGFR, CASP3, PPARG, and PTGS2 as the core targets of Duhuo in RA treatment. Enrichment results indicated involvement in cancer signaling, the MAPK pathway, PI3K-Akt signaling, and the prolactin signaling pathway. These findings suggest that Duhuo exerts anti-RA effects through multiple components, targets, and signaling pathways.",

However, vascular interventional surgery (VIS) with flexible catheters and soft tissue raises challenges to autonomous execution of preplanned tasks due to indeterminately changed surgical state. We present a novel end-to-end deep learning-based framework of human-robot collaborative navigation for VIS. A surgical Generative Adversarial Networks is employed for real-time local path planning of the catheter tip under variable-vascular-contour environment. A CNNs-based action estimator is proposed for nonlinear mapping from the tip's path to the end's action. A human-robot trust-based shared control model is established for surgical navigation. The networks are trained by a self-built dataset and experiments are conducted under catheterization room environment. The results show the catheter's action decision accuracy achieves 93.75%. The surgical effectiveness and safety are improved with the proposed method. This work provides a way to achieve autonomous VIS.",

  "title": "Detection of Ethylene Signaling Using Bioinformatics Tools in Plants.",
  "abstract": "Ethylene is a gaseous hormone that is vital in plant growth, development, biotic or abiotic stresses, fruit ripening, and senescence. The ethylene signaling machinery includes several genes, many of which are multigene family members and exhibit spatial and temporal expression patterns. These genes also show divergence and expansion during evolution. Recent high-throughput technologies have promoted a more comprehensive profiling of genes regulated by ethylene signaling. The availability of a large amount of sequencing data from whole genome, transcriptome, small RNA, etc., in the public databases provides an informative resource for gene mining of ethylene. However, these omics data generally result in large gene lists that make it challenging to interpret the data and extract insights into biological significance. Different platforms have different architectures and designs, and even similar studies using the same platform may obtain data with significant variances because of the highly dynamic and flexible effects of plant hormones, making comparisons across different studies and platforms difficult. Hence, the method of analysis suggests the requirement of database for their respective analysis. Some of the databases reported to find the genomics, transcriptomics, and regulatory mechanism of ethylene are The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR), Banana Genome Hub (BGH), Citrus genome database (CGD), OneKP database, miRDeep-2, miRDP, psRNATarget, Arabidopsis Hormone Database (AHD), and gene set-level analyses of hormone responses (GSHR). The present chapter deals with the online and offline methods and basic workflow for the detection of ethylene signaling machinery.",

  "title": "Segmentation of honeycomb cysts, traction bronchiectasis and emphysematous lung parenchyma using the deep learning method.",
  "abstract": "This study aimed to perform the segmentation of honeycomb cysts, traction bronchiectasis, and emphysematous lung parenchyma in highresolution computed tomography (HRCT) examinations using the deep learning method of artificial intelligence. The study included the cross-sectional images of 265 patients diagnosed with usual interstitial pneumonia between 2017 and 2021. Minimum intensity projection (MinIP) was performed on axial sections in the parenchymal window. Emphysema areas, traction bronchiectasis, and honeycomb cysts were segmented and labeled on the axial HRCT images. The dataset was divided into three parts, namely training, validation, and testing, at a ratio of 80, 10, and 10%, respectively. The results were calculated by selecting 50% as the threshold value for the intersection over union (Jaccard index) statistic. Of the 265 patients included in the study, 184 (69.4%) were male and 81 (30.6%) were female. Mean age of the patients was 73 ± 10 years. In the test group segmented as emphysema, the sensitivity, precision, F1 score, area under the curve (AUC), and accuracy values were calculated as 0.81, 0.90, 0.85, 0.86, and 0.75, respectively. In the test group segmented as traction bronchiectasis, the sensitivity, precision, F1 score, AUC, and accuracy values were found to be 0.95, 0.76, 0.85, 0.80, and 0.75, respectively. In the test group segmented as honeycomb cysts, the sensitivity, precision, F1 score, AUC, and accuracy values were 0.96, 0.92, 0.94, 0.88, and 0.90, respectively. In this study, we successfully utilized the U-Net architecture, a deep learning technology, to accurately segment honeycomb cysts in MinIP images, one of the parameters that will help classify interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). We anticipate that our study will guide future studies on the classification of ILDs.",

  "title": "Multi-generational labour markets: Data-driven discovery of multi-perspective system parameters using machine learning.",
  "abstract": "The impact of aggressive capitalist approaches on social, economic and planet sustainability is significant. Economic issues such as inflation, energy costs, taxes and interest rates persist and are further exacerbated by global events such as wars, pandemics and environmental disasters. A sustained history of financial crises exposes weaknesses in modern economies. The Great Attrition, with many quitting jobs, adds to concerns. The diversity of the workforce poses new challenges. Transformative approaches are essential to safeguard societies, economies and the planet. In this work, we use big data and machine learning methods to discover multi-perspective parameters for multi-generational labour markets. The parameters for the academic perspective are discovered using 35,000 article abstracts from the Web of Science for the period 1958-2022 and for the professionals' perspective using 57,000 LinkedIn posts from 2022. We discover a total of 28 parameters and categorized them into five macro-parameters, Learning & Skills, Employment Sectors, Consumer Industries, Learning & Employment Issues and Generations-specific Issues. A complete machine learning software tool is developed for data-driven parameter discovery. A variety of quantitative and visualization methods are applied and multiple taxonomies are extracted to explore multi-generational labour markets. A knowledge structure and literature review of multi-generational labour markets using over 100 research articles is provided. It is expected that this work will enhance the theory and practice of artificial intelligence-based methods for knowledge discovery and system parameter discovery to develop autonomous capabilities and systems and promote novel approaches to labour economics and markets, leading to the development of sustainable societies and economies.",
